<h1>About This App</h1>
<h2>What is this app? </h2>
<p>Sweat &amp; Toil: Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking Around the World is a comprehensive resource developed by the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) documenting child labor and forced labor worldwide. Data and research in this app are taken from ILAB&rsquo;s three flagship reports: <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/" title="Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor"><em>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</em></a>; <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/" title="List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor"><em>List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</em></a>; and <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-products/index-country.htm" title="List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor"><em>List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor</em></a>. This app fits these three information-packed reports the size of a phone book in the palm of your hand. Key things you can do with this app are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check countries&rsquo; efforts to eliminate child labor;</li>
<li>Find child labor data;</li>
<li>Browse goods produced with child labor or forced labor;</li>
<li>Review laws, ratifications, and enforcement efforts; and</li>
<li>See what governments, businesses, and consumers can to do end child labor.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What is the purpose of these reports?</h2>
<p>As a starting point for action, these reports are intended to raise public awareness about child labor and forced labor around the world and to promote and inform efforts to address them. The research helps inform Congress and Executive Branch agencies that formulate labor and trade policy and is an important resource for USDOL in assessing future technical assistance and research priorities as it seeks to combat child labor around the world. It is also a valuable resource for foreign governments, researchers, advocacy organizations, and businesses wishing to carry out risk assessments and engage in due diligence on labor rights in their supply chains.</p>
<h2>How can I use this app?</h2>
<p>Using this app can be a starting point to empower yourself with knowledge about child labor or forced labor around the world. Anyone with an interest in these issues &ndash; governments, businesses, academics, civil society, and consumers &ndash; can use it as a source of information to begin asking questions, taking action, and demanding change. And because this app makes this information both portable and available offline, you can use it in any corner of the world, for on-the-ground engagement or education on these issues. We are also making the data available to developers to use in their own applications, data visualizations, and mashups with other data sets through our <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/child-labor" title="API">API</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Are there new features to the app?</h2>
<p>Sweat &amp; Toil 3.0 is now in its third year, and contains the latest information from the 2016 reporting period. New features include an updated legal standards section, which includes whether national laws meet international standards, and more comprehensive data on military recruitment laws. In the labor enforcement section, data are available on whether countries meet the ILO recommended number of labor inspectors as defined by development classification levels and workforce size.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s in the Legal Standards Section?</h2>
<p>The Legal Standards Section now contains information on whether national laws meet internationally defined standards to protect children from child labor and its worst forms. This includes minimum age laws and those relating to working conditions, the worst forms of child labor, and education. It also includes more comprehensive data on military recruitment laws.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes/No reflects whether a country&rsquo;s laws meet international standards.</li>
<li>The data appears green when a country&rsquo;s laws are compliant with international standards. When the data appears red, a country&rsquo;s legislative framework lacks basic protections, either due to the absence of laws or gaps in existing laws.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, consult the country profile linked to the country page, under <em>Report PDF.</em></p>
<h2>How do I determine the exploitation types that are known to exist in the production of certain goods?</h2>
<p>The Exploitation Type page gives an overview of all goods listed in the TVPRA and EO reports. Icons represent child labor, forced (adult) labor, and forced child labor. Filter buttons provide a quick way to examine specific exploitation types and their associated goods. Forced child labor (FCL) is a type of child labor (CL), so the filter for forced child labor will also pick up child labor. However, when all three exploitation types exist, only FL and FCL will appear.</p>
<h2>Why isn&rsquo;t every country in the world represented here?</h2>
<p>This has to do with the data availability and the scope of Congressional mandates that govern USDOL&rsquo;s reporting on these issues. For more information about these mandates and the three reports this app draws from, read our methodology page.</p>
<h2>Have ideas for ways to improve the app, want to submit information on child labor or forced labor globally, or need help with technical issues?</h2>
<p>Please use <a href="mailto:GlobalKids@dol.gov" title="mailto:GlobalKids@dol.gov">GlobalKids@dol.gov</a> to email any ideas for ways to improve the app, submit information regarding child labor or forced labor globally, or ask questions related to technical issues.
