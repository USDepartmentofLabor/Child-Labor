		<Description>In 2014, Afghanistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Afghanistan announced the adoption of a list of 29 occupations and working conditions prohibited for children. The Government also took steps to combat child trafficking by acceding to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and issuing a directive to improve enforcement of the current law on human trafficking. In addition, the Government passed a law criminalizing the recruitment of children under age 18 into state security institutions and the Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee on Children and Armed Conflict approved a new roadmap to support efforts to end underage recruitment. However, children in Afghanistan are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced production of bricks. Children also continued to be recruited and used for military purposes by non-state groups, and were in limited instances used by some members of state groups to carry out specific tasks. Afghanistan&#8217;s labor inspectorate does not have legal authority to enforce child labor laws, and the Government lacks programs to eliminate child labor in certain sectors in which it is prevalent.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Albania made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government participated in and supported the publication of the first national assessment of street children in Albania, providing valuable data on the demographics and work activities of street children. The National Council for the Protection of Children&#8217;s Rights also held its first meeting after having remained inactive since its launch in 2011. The Government also trained labor inspectors, police officers, prosecutors, and judges on human trafficking issues. However, children in Albania are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. The Government does not have sufficient resources to enforce laws on child labor, including its worst forms. In addition, programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

The Government approved an amendment to the Penal Code that fully prohibits child pornography, and funded awareness campaigns to sensitize the population on child labor. However, children in Algeria are engaged in child labor, including in street work and domestic work. Algerian law does not clearly establish 18 as the minimum age for hazardous work, and prohibitions against hazardous occupations and activities are not specific enough to facilitate enforcement. The law does not prohibit the use of children in illicit activities and the Government does not make data on law enforcement efforts publicly available.</Description>

The Government acceded to the Palermo Protocol, passed a new law protecting all children from human trafficking for sexual and economic exploitation, established a Commission to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and trained criminal law enforcement officials. However, children in Angola are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and mining. There are gaps in the legal framework to protect children from exploitation, including a lack of prohibitions on the use of children in illicit activities. Additionally, there is little publicly available information on the Government&#8217;s efforts to enforce laws on child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Anguilla made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Government participated in the Child Safeguarding in the Overseas Territories Regional Project, a project designed by the United Kingdom&#8217;s Department for International Development and UNICEF to increase the Government&#8217;s capacity to address child protection issues. The Government also signed the Inter-Agency Child Protection Protocol to facilitate interagency collaboration on child protection issues. However, although the problem does not appear to be widespread, children in Anguilla are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, specifically in commercial sexual exploitation. The law in Anguilla does not appear to prohibit children ages 14 to 18 from engaging in dangerous work or provide a comprehensive list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. The Government also lacks a developed framework and targeted programs that address the commercial sexual exploitation of children.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Argentina made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government ratified ILO Convention 189 Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers in its effort to ensure compulsory schooling and minimum age protections for young domestic workers. The Government&#8217;s Provincial Commissions for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor (COPRETI) provided key trainings to labor inspectors on child labor issues, and the Executive Council to Fight Human Trafficking provided additional training to officials on human trafficking issues. The National Registry of Agricultural Workers and Employers (RENATEA) also launched a program to lengthen the school day and create child care centers for children of agricultural laborers to reduce their vulnerability to child labor. However, children in Argentina are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Argentina has not adopted a list of hazardous occupations that are prohibited for children, and the country appears to lack programs that target working children in several key sectors.</Description>

		<Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement</Advancement_Level>
		<Description>In 2014, Armenia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Armenia has received an assessment of minimal advancement because the Government lacks a labor inspectorate to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws. This gap in enforcement delays the advancements made in eliminating child labor during the reporting period. In addition, the Government lacks a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address all forms of child labor, including its worst forms, and no programs exist to aid children engaged in work activities on the street or in agriculture. Children in Armenia continue to engage in child labor in the services sector. Despite these gaps, the Government did make efforts to prevent and eliminate child labor, including enacting legislation to improve the identification of and provision of services to victims of human trafficking.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Azerbaijan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed amendments to the Administrative Offenses Code and the Criminal Code that impose a fine or imprisonment for employing people without an effective employment agreement, thereby providing children working without a contract with protection. The Government also instituted a new National Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, and law enforcement officials received training on best practices in investigating and prosecuting cases of human trafficking. In addition, the Government funded a program for the rehabilitation of child victims of human trafficking. However, children in Azerbaijan are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. There are gaps in Azerbaijan&#8217;s labor inspection system and in the training of its law enforcement officials. In addition, research found limited evidence of government programs to address child labor in the sectors where it is most prevalent.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Bangladesh made a moderate advancement in its efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government formed the National Child Labor Welfare Council to coordinate its efforts to eliminate child labor, including its worst forms, but the Council did not meet during the reporting period. The Ministry of Labor and Employment also hired 152 new labor inspectors and provided training to new and existing inspectors. However, children in Bangladesh are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and domestic work. The legal framework does not protect children working in informal economic sectors, including small farms, street work, and domestic work, where child labor is most prevalent.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Barbados made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government created the National Committee for Monitoring the Rights of the Child to protect the rights of children and to implement the UN CRC. The Government also supported and continued social programs that may help prevent child labor. However, although the problem does not appear to be widespread, children in Barbados are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in drug trafficking and in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Important legislative gaps remain. For example, Barbados lacks a legally enforceable list of hazardous occupations prohibited for children. In addition, the Government does not have a comprehensive policy framework to address all relevant forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Belize made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government provided training on child labor issues to law enforcement agencies, and developed a new program to train officials on its trafficking in persons and commercial sexual exploitation legislation, passed in 2013. However, children in Belize are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Important gaps in the country&#8217;s legal framework remain. Belize does not set a minimum age of 14 for work for all sectors, and the country lacks a list of hazardous occupations that are prohibited for children. In addition, the Government does not appear to have programs that aim to reduce child labor in agriculture, a sector in which it remains prevalent.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Benin made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the National Policy for Child Protection and the Action Plan to Eradicate Child Exploitation in major national markets. The Government also increased the capacity of the Office for the Protection of Minors by extending its child protection services to 12 geographical departments of Benin where they did not previously exist. The Government continued to operate social advancement centers that provide social and reintegration services to children withdrawn from child trafficking and labor. However, children in Benin are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and particularly in the production of cotton, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. The national action plan pertaining to the worst forms of child labor remains unfunded and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Bhutan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government and UNODC launched the Enhance Government and Civil Society Responses to Counter Trafficking in Persons program. The Government also worked with UNDAF to launch the Bhutan One Program, which includes initiatives to prevent and respond to violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect of children. However, children in Bhutan are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Bhutan&#8217;s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards and education is not compulsory. Law enforcement agencies did not provide any data on actions to combat child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Bolivia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor increased its number of labor inspectors from 78 to 95, and dedicated 9 of these inspectors to investigating child labor in high-risk areas. The Government also published a national policy to combat human trafficking that aims to implement the Comprehensive Law against Human Trafficking and Smuggling. However, children in Bolivia are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in mining. Bolivia has received an assessment of minimal advancement because in July 2014, the Government passed a new Child and Adolescent Code that allows children as young as 10 years old to be self-employed under certain conditions. This action undermined the advancements made in eliminating child labor. In addition, the Offices of the Child Advocate, required by the new Code to authorize child work and assist victims of child labor, are absent or underfunded in many municipalities, leaving some children unprotected and vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The Government also lacks a comprehensive child labor policy.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government strengthened human trafficking victim identification efforts, tripling the number of victims identified from the previous year. In addition to allocating $1.8 million for implementation of the Decade of Roma Inclusion Action Plan, the Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees (MHRR) also continued collaborating with NGOs on a project aimed at registering Romani people for citizenship. However, children in BiH are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each as a result of human trafficking. The Government does not have a comprehensive list of hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children. Additionally, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) Government has yet to pass an anti-human trafficking amendment that would harmonize its criminal code with state-level legislation and ensure the prohibition of all forms of human trafficking across the entire country.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Botswana made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed the Anti-Human Trafficking Bill which criminalizes and penalizes perpetrators that engage in trafficking of children. The Government continued its Stay-in-School Program which trains teachers and social workers on how to talk to parents about the importance of education. However, children in Botswana continue to engage in child labor in cattle herding in rural areas and domestic service in urban centers. Key gaps remain in the country&#8217;s legal framework against child labor, and enforcement of existing laws is insufficient.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Brazil made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government created mobile inspection units to coordinate child labor law enforcement efforts between regional Ministry of Labor and other local inspectors. Law 12.978 was signed; it specifies penalties in the Penal Code for the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Inspectors carried out inspections targeting child labor in 165 commercial establishments in the state of Bahia during Brazil&#8217;s Carnival season in February, and in many tourist sites during the World Cup in June. The National Education Plan was also signed, and an additional 9 million schools participated in the More Education (Mais Educa&#231;&#227;o) program. However, children are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Some local governments lack adequate resources to fully implement national programs to combat child labor, including programs to combat child trafficking.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Burkina Faso made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government published a study on hazardous child labor in order to update existing legislation and established the National Coordination Committee for the National Action Plan on the Fight against the Worst Forms of Child Labor. The Government also adopted Law N&#176; 011-2014/AN Suppressing the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, which strengthens existing prohibitions on commercial sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. However, children in Burkina Faso are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor and the lack of funding has hampered the implementation of child labor policies. Despite an uprising in October that ousted longtime President Blaise Compaor&#233;, the Government continued to address child labor issues.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Burundi made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed an anti-trafficking in persons law. The government also successfully prosecuted offenders for trafficking girls into domestic service. However, children in Burundi are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Education in Burundi is not compulsory, increasing the risk of children&#8217;s involvement in child labor. In addition, the Government did not conduct any child labor inspections during the reporting period.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Cambodia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT) created 24 interdepartmental inspection teams, which include a child labor inspector, and significantly increased the number of inspections and the number of inspectors trained to conduct child labor investigations. Additionally, the Government made several efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP), including drafting guidelines for the identification and referral of victims of TIP and sexual exploitation, and implementing them in six target areas. However, children in Cambodia continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor as victims of human trafficking. The legal framework leaves children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor as there is no compulsory education requirement, and the law allows children as young as age 12 to engage in domestic work. Labor inspectors lack sufficient resources to adequately monitor child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Cameroon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government created a National Steering Committee to combat child labor and adopted a National Action Plan against Child Labor and Trafficking in Persons. The Government also adopted a Decent Work Country Program that includes child labor issues and continued to support programs that increase access to education and health care. However, children in Cameroon are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government has not ratified UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, nor has it prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, the Central African Republic (CAR) made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. A cease-fire agreement between armed groups was signed in July, and the Government began drafting a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) strategy with the support of the UN and other international partners, but has yet to fully implement it. However, children in CAR are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forced or compulsory recruitment by armed groups. Widespread violence and continued instability limited the Government&#8217;s ability to address the worst forms of child labor and armed groups on all sides of the conflict increased their use of child soldiers. Research found no evidence that enforcement actions were taken to address child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Chad made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government issued Ordinance 001/PR/2014, which criminalized the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, and signed a protocol with the UN that includes protections for children associated with armed groups, regardless of their country of origin. The Ministry of Women, Social Action, and National Solidarity also integrated a mandatory course on child protection into the curriculum of training institutions for police, gendarmerie, judges, military personnel, and social workers. Additionally, the UN Secretary General removed Chad from its list of governments that recruit and use child soldiers. However, children in Chad are engaged in child labor, including in cattle herding and agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Many gaps remain in the legal framework and there are no specific laws that prohibit the use of children in illicit activities.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Chile made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government created the Social Observatory to Eradicate Child Labor, a coordinating mechanism for research and outreach efforts on child and adolescent labor. As part of the ongoing implementation of Education Decree 280 of 2009, indigenous language and cultural education is now required at schools with 20 percent or more indigenous children. The National Minors&#8217; Service (SENAME) assisted 1,290 child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. SENAME registered 386 cases in its Worst Forms of Child Labor Registry. Chile also continued to implement several programs targeting the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Chile are engaged in child labor, including in retail, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in illicit activities. The Government has yet to adopt a new national plan against child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Colombia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed Law 1719, which guarantees access to legal services for victims of commercial sexual exploitation and armed conflict; implemented Child Labor Pacts to assist in the formulation of child labor policies and laws and improve coordination between the Ministry of Labor and other government agencies; and launched the Network Against Child Labor campaign to unite 14 businesses in efforts to eliminate child labor in their supply chains. The Government also continued to participate in a project to combat child labor and improve workplace health and safety in mining. However, children in Colombia are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and street work, and in the worst forms of child labor as they continue to be forcibly recruited by illegal non-state armed groups. Limited interagency coordination and inadequate resources hinder Government efforts to combat child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Comoros made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government approved the Law to Combat Child Labor and Trafficking, which strengthened penalties for child labor and child trafficking. The Law also provides legal protection and social assistance to victims of the worst forms of child labor and child trafficking. The Government also increased the coverage of the Police Morals and Minors Brigade by establishing new brigades on the islands of Anjouan and Moheli, where the majority of human trafficking cases reportedly occur. However, children in Comoros are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work. A gap between the minimum age for work and the age for compulsory education leaves children ages 13 to 15 vulnerable to child labor. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government took steps to implement a UN-backed action plan to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers, including by convening national and provincial working groups, appointing a presidential adviser on sexual violence and child recruitment, and arresting several individuals on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers. However, children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to engage in child labor, including in domestic work, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, cassiterite (tin ore), coltan (tantalum ore), and wolframite (tungsten ore). The Government failed to prosecute or convict any individual of child labor violations, and the prescribed penalties for forced or compulsory labor remain low and do not serve as a deterrent. There are few social programs to assist child laborers, and laws and regulations mandating free primary education are not enforced.</Description>

The Government launched the National Action Plan to Fight Against Trafficking in Persons, which aims to improve enforcement activities related to child trafficking. The Government also began implementing a social safety net program to improve access to health and education services for poor families, and assumed a greater financial responsibility for a school feeding program that targeted 215,000 children. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are engaged in child labor, including in domestic work and the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, the Cook Islands made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Government participated in UNDAF Pacific, which includes youth initiatives related to access to education and security in the Cook Islands. Also, the Government began a baseline study on youth participation in the workforce, which will result in a Youth Monograph. Although research found no evidence that child labor, including its worst forms, exists in the Cook Islands, the Government&#8217;s legal framework is insufficient to prevent children from engaging in prostitution and pornography, and research could not determine whether laws prohibit internal trafficking in persons or use of children in illicit activities.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Costa Rica made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government ratified the ILO Convention on Domestic Workers and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a Communications Procedure. The Government also increased funding for the Inspection Office and developed an inter-agency coordination manual on the protection of child and adolescent victims of human trafficking, child labor, and commercial sexual exploitation. However, children in Costa Rica are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and commercial sexual exploitation. Social programs do not reach all child laborers and resources for the Government&#8217;s child labor law enforcement agencies remain inadequate.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government conducted a labor survey which included a subsurvey to determine the activities of working children; issued a decree to implement the Trafficking and Worst Forms of Child Labor Law that was adopted in 2010; and adopted a National Policy Document on Child Protection. The Government also established a National Committee for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons; increased the budget of the Directorate for the Fight Against Child Labor by $800,000; continued to support social programs that address child labor in support of activities under the National Action Plan Against Trafficking, Exploitation, and Child Labor (NAP); and completed the pilot phase of the child labor monitoring system known as Syst&#232;me d&#8217;Observation et de Suivi du Travail des Enfants en C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (SOSTECI). However, children in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in domestic work and agriculture, particularly on cocoa farms, sometimes under conditions of forced labor. Gaps remain in enforcement efforts and in children&#8217;s access to education.</Description>

The Government drafted a National Action Plan on Human Trafficking and a Strategic Education Plan. With support from multilateral organizations, the Government continued to provide social services to children at risk of child labor, including migrants. However, children in Djibouti are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Significant gaps remain in the legal framework on child labor. Neither law enforcement efforts nor programs to assist working children are adequate.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Dominica made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Government continued to conduct labor inspections and support programs to reduce poverty and ensure access to education. Research found no evidence that child labor, including its worst forms, exists in Dominica. However, there has not been a recent study of child labor to confirm this. National legislation does not expressly prohibit child prostitution, child pornography, or the use of children in illicit activities, including drug trafficking. In addition, the minimum age for both light work and hazardous work falls below international standards, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement</Advancement_Level>
		<Description>In 2014, the Dominican Republic made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Dominican Republic is receiving this assessment because certain children remain at increased vulnerability to labor exploitation due to limitations on educational opportunities related to the interpretation and implementation of Dominican law and policies on the right to education. During the reporting period, the Government passed a new Penal Code that increases penalties for the commercial sexual exploitation of children and ratified the UN CRC Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict. In addition, the Government signed the Protocol for the Protection of Children&#8217;s and Adolescents&#8217; Rights in Child Labor, which aims to eliminate child labor and increase school attendance. The Government also expanded educational programs and signed the Education Pact, a plan to reform the education system by improving teacher training, building more schools, and increasing attendance. However, children in the Dominican Republic are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Due to misinterpretations and misapplications of Dominican law and policies on the right to education, school officials do not permit some children, particularly those of Haitian descent, to enroll in primary and secondary education without birth certificates or other identifying documentation. These incorrectly-applied provisions prevent or discourage children not entitled to Dominican documents, or unable to obtain documents from their countries of nationality, from enrolling in or completing school. In addition, difficulties in the implementation of a naturalization law passed in May 2014 have hindered the acquisition of both Haitian and Dominican identity documents under that law, adding to difficulties labor inspectors and employers have in verifying affected children&#8217;s ages for work.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Ecuador made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government issued Official Registry No. 221, which provides that the regional Ministry of Labor offices register adolescent workers, protecting their rights and formalizing their employment. The National Police Unit for Crimes against Children and Adolescents (DINAPEN) conducted 84 operations to combat commercial sexual exploitation and rescued 56 children and adolescents. The Ministry of Tourism and DINAPEN signed an agreement to coordinate the prevention of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Ecuador also continued to participate in a number of programs targeting the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Ecuador continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Ecuador still faces resource constraints that prevent labor inspectors from conducting inspections and enforcing child labor laws.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Egypt made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government ratified a new Constitution, which defines a child as anyone under the age of 18, guarantees children&#8217;s right to public education, and prohibits children from being employed in dangerous occupations. The Government began to systematically collect data on human trafficking and introduced a compulsory training on human trafficking for new prosecutors. Additionally, the Government reactivated the National Coordinating Committee to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labor. The Government also participated in a program designed to improve school attendance. However, children in Egypt are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and domestic work. The Government did not publicly make available data on the enforcement of child labor laws, including its worst forms. In addition, programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, El Salvador made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government signed the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, a development initiative that includes among its many goals increasing educational and vocational training opportunities for youth and combatting human trafficking. The Government passed the Special Law Against Trafficking in Persons that increased penalties for the trafficking of children to a minimum of 16 years in prison, and permanently established the Attorney General&#8217;s anti-trafficking unit and the National Council Against Trafficking in Persons (CNCTP). The Government&#8217;s National Council for Children and Adolescents (CONNA) provided technical assistance in developing Departmental and Local Committees for Children&#8217;s and Adolescents&#8217; Rights, pursuant to the Law for the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents (LEPINA). The Government also expanded educational programs that aim to keep children in schools and out of harmful activities by providing meals, supplies, and extracurricular activities. However, children in El Salvador are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in illicit activities sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Law enforcement agencies continue to lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws, and monetary penalties for labor violations remain low.</Description>

While the Government ratified the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, Eritrea is receiving this assessment of no advancement because it continued to require children to participate in a national program called Maetot, under which children in grades 9 to 11 engage in agricultural, environmental, or hygiene-related public works projects for varying amounts of time during their annual summer holidays from school. In addition, although Eritrean law prohibits the recruitment of children under age 18 into the armed forces, there may be children enrolled in the Government&#8217;s compulsory military training program. Gaps in the legal framework exist, including a lack of specific penalties for employers of children in hazardous work and employers of children under the minimum age for work.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Ethiopia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Ethiopia ratified the UN CRC Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict and the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. The Government also made a number of efforts to improve labor law enforcement, and participated in and implemented several programs, including the launching of a large-scale education improvement project, to combat the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Ethiopia are engaged in child labor including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work. Ethiopia still lacks a compulsory education law which leaves children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor have not sufficiently targeted sectors with a high incidence of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, the Falkland Islands made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although no information suggests that the worst forms of child labor are a problem, the Government appears to lack a complete preventive legal framework to protect all children from trafficking for the purposes of labor exploitation. It also is unclear whether the Falkland Islands have established a more comprehensive list of hazardous work prohibited to children, and whether the use of children in illicit activities is prohibited. This leaves children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

The Ministry of Employment, Productivity, and Industrial Relations (MEPIR) appointed 18 additional labor inspectors and for the first time, Fiji&#8217;s courts convicted and sentenced two perpetrators for the crime of trafficking in children and issued a heavy penalty for a violation of child labor law. The Government also approved the Free Education Grant policy that provides 13 years of free, basic education to children in Fiji and implemented a transportation assistance program that will improve access to schools for children in the most remote areas of the country. However, children in Fiji are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and street work. Fiji has not ratified the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography or the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons. In addition, the Government has yet to finalize the National Action Plan for Child Labor and 5-year Strategic Plan for Combatting Child Labor.</Description>

The Government ratified UN CRC Optional Protocol on a Communications Procedure, which allows children to bring complaints to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child when their rights have been violated. The Government also completed a Rapid Situational Analysis on Child Domestic Work which includes a proposal to address gaps in social services, and launched a program to provide birth certificates to 20,000 Gabonese citizens with birth certificates. However, children in Gabon are engaged in child labor, including in domestic work and street vending. The Government continues to delay the development of a list of hazardous occupations prohibited for children under age 18 and has yet to conduct a proposed study on children trafficked into domestic work.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, The Gambia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government&#8217;s Ministry of Education continued the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) initiative that provided subsidies to marabouts to support discontinuing the marabouts&#39; practice of forcing students to beg in the streets. In addition, The Gambia Tourism Board (GTB) co-funded the installation of an electronic billboard at Banjul International Airport to warn visitors of the penalties of engaging in child sex tourism. The GTB also held five seminars on child sex tourism for 190 law enforcement officers, tourism industry operators, and members of the public. However, children in The Gambia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in street work and commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps in the legal framework persist, such as between compulsory education and minimum working ages. In addition, child labor laws are not effectively enforced, and existing social programs are not sufficient to meet the need.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Georgia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Georgia has received an assessment of minimal advancement because the Government lacked a labor inspectorate to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws during the reporting period. (Although past Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor reports have reflected the absence of a labor inspectorate in Georgia, Georgia&#8217;s assessment level in previous years did not reflect the extent to which this gap in enforcement delays advancements made in eliminating child labor. Georgia has not had a labor inspectorate to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws since 2006, when the Government abolished the labor inspectorate that existed at that time.) This continued gap in enforcement delays the advancements made in eliminating child labor during the reporting period. Although the Government participated in a project to improve its ability to enforce labor laws and adhere to international labor standards, including those related to child labor, the Government did not take steps to establish a labor inspectorate during the reporting period. Children in Georgia continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in forced begging. Despite these gaps, the Government did make efforts to prevent and eliminate child labor, including participating in a project to collect and analyze data on child labor in Georgia.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Ghana made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government reconstituted the Human Trafficking Management Board (HTMB), which had been inactive in 2013. Additionally, the Ghana Police Service&#8217;s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) nearly doubled the number of investigators it employs and provided members with training on how to identify, investigate, and prosecute child labor cases. The Government also released the results of its Living Standards Survey Round 6, which included a subsection dedicated to child labor. However, children in Ghana continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in agriculture, including in cocoa and fishing. Enforcement of legal protections against the worst forms of child labor is severely limited due to resource constraints, and social programs do not cover all of the sectors in which children work.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Grenada made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, which specifically prohibits the trafficking of children for labor and commercial sexual exploitation. The Government participated in the XVIII Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor discussions on the prevention and elimination of child labor, and continued to support programs that provide school meals, uniforms, and transportation costs to students of low-income families. While the worst forms of child labor do not appear to be a problem in Grenada, the Government&#8217;s ability to prevent children from becoming engaged in exploitative work is limited due to a lack of express prohibitions against children&#8217;s involvement in hazardous work and illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Guatemala made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government signed the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, a development initiative that includes among its many goals increasing educational and vocational training opportunities for youth and combatting human trafficking. The Government also implemented the Public Policy on Human Trafficking and Comprehensive Protection of Victims (2014&#8211;2024), establishing government-run shelters for victims of human trafficking. The Secretariat Against Sexual Violence, Exploitation, and Trafficking in Persons&#8217; (SVET) budget reached $2 million, the highest in its history. Also, for the first time in Guatemala, six individuals were prosecuted by the Public Ministry and convicted of trafficking for labor purposes. However, children in Guatemala are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The lack of government resources, inability of the labor inspectorate to impose fines, and inadequate judicial enforcement of court orders remain key challenges for enforcement efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor. The Government delayed payments to recipients from the conditional cash transfer program, Mi Bono Seguro, and there is a lack of social programs targeting sectors in which children are known to engage in exploitative labor, such as domestic work and agriculture, as well as other sectors.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Guinea made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Transition Council approved a new Labor Code that defines the worst forms of child labor in accordance to international standards and includes prohibitions against minors performing work that is dangerous or harmful to their physical or moral health. The Government also extended the National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons for an additional year and funded a center to protect victims of child trafficking. However, children in Guinea are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. The Government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. In addition, there are limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem. During the last half of 2014, the Government had to redirect most of its resources to address an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Hundreds of children became ill or lost parents during the outbreak and schools were closed from June through December.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Guyana made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor, Human Services and Social Security held a forum on World Day Against Child Labor to discuss the implementation of systems to combat child labor and raise awareness throughout the country. The Ministerial Task Force on Trafficking in Persons released a 2014&#8211;2015 Action Plan and held a series of talks to educate communities on human trafficking. The Government continues to provide free uniforms and school meals to encourage school attendance. However, children in Guyana continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Guyana&#8217;s legislation does not fully protect children from the worst forms of child labor, and the labor inspectorate lacks sufficient funding and capacity to carry out inspections. The Government does not have a comprehensive policy to combat child labor and existing social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Haiti made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law, which criminalizes all forms of human trafficking and contains provisions to prevent child trafficking and other worst forms of child labor. The law also creates a National Committee for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons that provides legal protection and social assistance to victims of human trafficking. The Government also created the Child Protection Working Group to coordinate efforts on child protection, specifically for children in domestic work. Moreover, Haiti ratified UN CRC Optional Protocols on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and Children in Armed Conflict. However, children in Haiti are engaged in child labor, including in domestic work and agriculture. Haiti lacks a clear, easily applicable minimum age for domestic work. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Honduras made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government signed the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, a development initiative that includes among its many goals increasing educational and vocational training opportunities for youth and combating human trafficking. The Government also created a Prosecutorial Task Force to investigate and prosecute human trafficking and the smuggling of unaccompanied migrant youth. In addition, the Government created the Directorate of Childhood, Adolescence, and Family (DINAF) to better monitor children&#8217;s rights and implement national plans concerning children and their families. However, children in Honduras are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking. The Government&#8217;s procedures for enforcement of child labor laws do not sufficiently deter employers from using child labor, and both labor inspectors and criminal investigators lack the resources they need to effectively carry out their mandates.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, India made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government implemented its National Child Labor Project to assist child laborers through the provision of loans and alternative livelihoods, and several social protection programs to address the root causes of child labor. The Ministry of Home Affairs also launched an online human trafficking portal to coordinate efforts of state and national government agencies. However, children in India are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and manufacturing. Basic legal protections for children remain weak. Legislation to prohibit work by all children under the age of 14 and to proscribe hazardous work for children under age 18 was approved by the Prime Minister&#8217;s Cabinet in 2012, but it has yet to be passed by Parliament.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Indonesia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor completed the third and final phase of the National Action Plan (NAP) for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2002&#8211;2022) by adopting the Roadmap for the Acceleration of Making Indonesia Free of Child Labor by 2022. Local governments issued regulations to harmonize local legislation with national legislation to reinforce the legal and regulatory framework regarding the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the Government allocated significant increases in funding to the Unconditional Cash Transfer program, which works to increase livelihoods of the poorest families, and the Block Grants for Schools program, which compensates schools for the loss of income incurred when waiving fees, thereby ensuring free education for poor and vulnerable children. However, children in Indonesia continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic service. The Government has yet to adopt the Domestic Worker&#8217;s Protection Bill which would be a stronger source of protections for child domestic workers. In addition, enforcement of child labor laws remains a challenge due to a lack of labor inspectors and sufficient resources to carry out effective inspections, and the Government lacks comprehensive, publically available data on child labor and trafficking investigations, violations, and convictions.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Iraq made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and UNICEF conducted a study on child labor. The Council of Representatives drafted a revised labor law and a child protection law. However, children are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. The compulsory education age is lower than the minimum age for work and child labor laws are not sufficiently enforced. The Government continues to lack programs that target children in relevant worst forms of child labor, particularly those used by armed groups.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Jamaica made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government conducted three assessments on child labor and released the Jamaica Multiple Cluster Survey report, which included information about children in the areas of health, education, child protection, and HIV/AIDS. Jamaica also expanded the Program for Advancement through Health and Education, a conditional cash transfer program, to reach more vulnerable families. In addition, the Government updated the curriculum for new police recruits by including an anti-trafficking training module. However, children in Jamaica are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Although the Government has laws prohibiting the use of children in some illicit activities, it does not prohibit the use of children for drug trafficking and production. In addition, programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

The Government adopted a new law that expands protection for child laborers including children engaged in street work and garbage collection; worked with international organizations to improve access to education for Jordanian and Syrian refugee children; increased the number of work inspections, including inspection campaigns in targeted sectors; and finalized a child labor monitoring system in cooperation with the ILO. However, children in Jordan are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work as a result of human trafficking. Child labor remains prevalent among Syrian refugee children, whose access to education is limited. In addition, programs to combat the worst forms of child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement</Advancement_Level>
		<Description>In 2014, Kazakhstan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Kazakhstan has received an assessment of minimal advancement because its President issued a decree in February 2014 placing a moratorium on inspections of small and medium-size businesses, resulting in the Government not enforcing its child labor laws. This gap in enforcement delays the advancements made in eliminating child labor during the reporting period. In addition, there is limited comprehensive and current research on child labor and programs to combat the worst forms of child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem. Children in Kazakhstan are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in cotton farming. Despite these gaps, the Government did make efforts to prevent and eliminate child labor, including making children engaged in the worst forms of child labor eligible for social protection services and developing a new national action plan on human trafficking.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Kenya made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government put into effect its List of Hazardous Occupations Prohibited to Children and conducted a trafficking in persons survey. The Government also provided cash transfers to an additional 90,000 households as part of its National Safety Net Program for Results, and participated in several programs to combat the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Kenya are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and fishing. Moreover, Kenya has yet to ratify the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography and has not committed sufficient resources to enforcement efforts.</Description>

It continued initiatives to raise awareness about child protection issues, including commercial sexual exploitation. The Government also trained police and prosecutors on trafficking in persons. However, children in Kiribati are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The law does not prohibit hazardous occupations or activities for children, and existing laws fail to fully protect children under age 18 from all forms of commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the Government did not make sufficient efforts to provide services to children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Kosovo made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government conducted a study on child labor as part of the implementation of its National Strategy and Action Plan for the Prevention and Elimination of Child Labor in Kosovo (SAP). The Government also drafted the 2014&#8211;2020 Sectorial Strategy and Action Plan to address issues of child labor in Kosovo. In addition, the Government issued two decisions determining the roles and responsibilities of educational institutions and agriculture sector employees in preventing and eliminating child labor. However, children in Kosovo are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children from minority communities continue to face barriers to accessing education. In addition, both the Labor Inspectorate and the Kosovo Police&#8217;s Directorate of Trafficking in Human Being Investigation face gaps in the availability of resources and the collection and publishing of data on enforcement efforts.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, the Kyrgyz Republic made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government began conducting a national child labor survey in collaboration with the ILO. However, children in the Kyrgyz Republic are engaged in child labor, including in cotton cultivation, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in tobacco cultivation. Interagency coordination on child labor continued to be poor and legal protections, such as minimum age of employment and prohibition on hazardous work, are not extended to children engaged in non-contractual employment.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Lebanon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. While both the anti-Human Trafficking National Action Plan and the National Action Plan for Human Rights await formal adoption by the Parliament, Government agencies in cooperation with other organizations began to implement them. The Government allowed Syrian refugee children to access education. The Reaching All Children through Education project, which aims to improve access to education, was launched. Also, the Ministry of Social Affairs in cooperation with UNICEF formed a program to enroll children in schools and improve working conditions for children. However, children in Lebanon continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Labor law enforcement is weak due to a lack of resources, and enforcement agencies do not maintain enforcement data. There are not sufficient programs and services that target children engaged in agriculture, street work, domestic service, or commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Lesotho made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed the National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor (APEC). In addition, the Ministry of Labor and Employment disseminated new guidelines on the protection of herd boys and the protection of children under age 18 from hazardous work. The Government fully funded the Lesotho Child Grant Program and the Orphans and Vulnerable Children Scholarship Program, allocating $3.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, to their 2013 and 2014 budgets. The Government also finalized and publicly launched the National Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Framework and Action Plan. In addition, the government launched the Southern African Development Community (SADC) data collection software. However, children in Lesotho continue to engage in child labor, including in domestic service and in the worst forms of child labor, including in cattle herding. Lesotho law does not prohibit the use of children in illicit activities, and a gap between the compulsory education age and the minimum age for employment that leaves children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. A lack of government resources for enforcement and social programs also remains a major challenge to combat child labor in Lesotho.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Liberia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the last half of 2014, the Government had to redirect most of its resources to address an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Thousands of children became ill or lost parents during the outbreak and schools were closed from June through the end of the reporting period in December. Despite the EVD outbreak, the Government sponsored trafficking in persons trainings for law enforcement officers and community leaders. The Child Protection Network developed a 6-month strategic plan to respond to vulnerable group of children in post-Ebola Liberia. However, children in Liberia are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and mining. The Government has yet to pass into law the Decent Work Bill, which prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children, and child labor law enforcement efforts are still inadequate.</Description>

Additionally, the Department of Justice set up a fund for the compensation of victims of human trafficking, including child trafficking victims. However, children are engaged in child labor, including in begging and the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The number of day centers and Centers for Social Work (CSWs) remains insufficient to provide shelter and other services to all vulnerable children in need of assistance. In addition, the National Plan of Action on the Rights of the Child and the National Action Plan against Trafficking in Persons and Illegal Migration lack the necessary funding for effective implementation.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Madagascar made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The newly elected Government adopted the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law, which criminalizes all forms of human trafficking and contains provisions to prevent child trafficking and other worst forms of child labor. The Regional Child Labor Committees in the Sava region organized workshops and conducted activities to raise awareness of child labor in the production of vanilla. The Government also adopted a National Development Plan that includes activities to combat the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the National Police Force&#8217;s Morals and Minors Brigade investigated an estimated 187 cases of child commercial sexual exploitation and referred them for prosecution. However, children in Madagascar are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and particularly in the production of vanilla and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

The Government continued to support social programs to address child labor, particularly in the tobacco sector, and expanded its social cash transfer program by an additional 34,000 households. It also approved a Child Protection Strategic Plan. However, children in Malawi continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture and fishing. The Government has not finalized or fully implemented key legislation or policies protecting children from the worst forms of child labor, including the Child Labor Policy and the Child Protection Policy.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Maldives made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Family and Child Protection Unit established four new &#8220;safe homes&#8221; to provide short-term protection for women and children. Anti-trafficking units, consisting of 10 officers dedicated to investigating human trafficking, were created in the Maldives Police Service (MPS) and the Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE). The Government also continued to fund and participate in programs to improve access to education. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Maldives are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Government has not determined specific hazardous occupations or activities that are prohibited for children and the compulsory education age of 13 leaves children ages 13 to 15 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Mali made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the National Policy for Child Promotion and Protection, which aims to strengthen national policies and programs to protect children from violence, human trafficking, and exploitative work. The Government also participated in several programs to combat the worst forms of child labor and assist vulnerable households. In northern Mali, the Government made progress in providing access to education by returning 83 percent of children to school and reopening 74 percent of schools for the 2013/2014 academic year. However, children in Mali are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in gold mining. Children were also abducted and forcibly recruited by armed rebel and extremist Islamic militia groups and some of these children were detained and charged with crimes for their association with these groups. Laws relating to the worst forms of child labor do not provide adequate coverage and gaps in enforcement have left children unprotected.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Mauritania made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the Roadmap for the Eradication of the Vestiges of Slavery based upon UN recommendations that raises awareness of slavery practices and implements programs that provide former slaves with access to education and livelihood opportunities. The Government also continued to operate regional centers that provide food, shelter, education, and training to children withdrawn from child labor. Further, the Government participated in two new programs to combat the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Mauritania are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and herding, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary servitude. Mauritania&#8217;s legal framework does not prohibit hazardous occupations and activities in all relevant child labor sectors, including agriculture; and does not prohibit the use of children in illicit activities. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Additionally, the Government continued to detain anti-slavery protestors.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Mauritius made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government funded and participated in several programs to combat the worst forms of child labor and assist vulnerable households. The Government also operated drop-in centers to provide services to children formerly engaged in commercial sexual exploitation. However, children in Mauritius are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. The Government does not currently ensure that victims of commercial sexual exploitation have access to comprehensive, quality services.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Moldova made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government updated its list of hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children and raised the compulsory education age to 18. The Government also took action to improve its policy framework by passing the sixth consecutive National Plan for Preventing and Combatting Human Trafficking, which develops a guide for improving prevention efforts, referral mechanisms, and support services for child victims of human trafficking. The Government also launched a new hotline to provide information and register complaints for children experiencing violence, neglect or exploitation, including exploitation through child labor. However, children in Moldova are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Funding for the State Labor Inspectorate (SLI) was not sufficient and the Inspectorate&#8217;s efforts to enforce child labor laws were hindered by barriers to conducting unannounced inspections. While the Government provides some financial support to programs addressing child labor, including human trafficking, most major child labor programs have been donor funded. These programs do not appear to be sustainable without outside financial assistance.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Mongolia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government established a Child Hotline to receive reports of child abuse and refer cases to the police, including reports related to exploitative child labor. In addition, law enforcement agencies improved efforts to monitor horse races for compliance with age and safety requirements for child horse jockeys. The Government&#8217;s Crime Prevention and Awareness Fund provided approximately $30,000 for Anti-Trafficking activities in 2014, including training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors on investigation and victim identification techniques. However, children in Mongolia are engaged in child labor, including in animal husbandry and herding and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Gaps persist in the legal framework and operating procedures for prosecuting criminal offenders, specifically regarding commercial sexual exploitation. The Government also lacks social programs to address child labor in certain relevant sectors.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Montenegro made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government amended the Labor Law to increase penalties for child labor violations and enacted the Foreigners Law, which includes protections for foreign victims of child trafficking and simplifies the process for identifying child trafficking victims. In addition, the Government reestablished the Council for the Rights of the Child to implement the National Plan for Children and adopted a new action plan to implement the Strategy for the Improvement of the Position of Roma and Other Minorities. However, children in Montenegro are engaged in child labor, including in begging and in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. The Government has not determined the types of hazardous occupations prohibited for children, and there are no programs that systematically address the problem of children involved in forced begging and other work on the streets.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Montserrat made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although no information suggest that the worst forms of child labor are a problem, gaps exist in the legal framework to prevent children from being involved in the worst forms of child labor. And although the Montserrat Labor Code protects children from performing hazardous work, it is unclear whether the Government has established a comprehensive list of hazardous activities. It also is unclear whether the law prohibits the use of children in illicit activities such as drug trafficking, begging, and theft or burglary. These gaps in legislation leave children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Morocco made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs established a mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor, conducted a study on the nature and extent of children labor on small farms, and supported significant efforts to combat child labor in the Marrakesh-Tensift-Al-Haouz region. However, children in Morocco are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Government continues to delay approving legislation that would protect children employed in domestic work and the number of labor inspectors is insufficient to effectively enforce child labor laws.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Mozambique made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed a new Penal Code which contains provisions on the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The Government also adopted a policy to increase birth registration nationwide, launched a social program to strengthen coordination to address human trafficking, and began conducting research on child labor. However, children in Mozambique are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and domestic work. Mozambique&#8217;s legal framework leaves gaps in prohibiting child labor, including its worst forms. The law does not prohibit hazardous occupations or activities for children and education is only compulsory until age 13, leaving children ages 13 to 14 vulnerable to child labor. Current programs target street children and child trafficking victims but do not address other sectors in which children engage in hazardous work.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Namibia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the Government established an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Child Labor to coordinate efforts between several ministries to combat the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the Ministry of Gender, Equality, and Child Welfare (MGECW) increased the number of shelters from six to eight for women and children to assist victims of sexual assault, gender-based violence, human trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor. In December, the Child Care and Protection Bill was passed by the National Assembly and reviewed by the National Council; the bill is awaiting signature by the President and placement in the gazette. However, children in Namibia are engaged in child labor, including in herding livestock, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps remain in existing laws regarding child prostitution and the use of children for illicit activities, the number of labor law inspectors decreased during the year, and resources for enforcement were insufficient.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Nepal made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Department of Labor increased its number of inspections by 25 percent, and the Nepali Police more than tripled its number of investigations and doubled the number of Women and Children Service Centers. In addition, the Ministry of Education began a pilot project for compulsory basic education, and several local governments funded activities and awareness-raising campaigns against child labor. However, children in Nepal are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Nepal lacks a compulsory education law, and children ages 16 and 17 are excluded from the protections of the country&#8217;s hazardous work list, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The number of investigations and convictions for child trafficking is also inadequate given the scope of trafficking in Nepal.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Nicaragua made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed the country&#8217;s first Law Against Trafficking in Persons, which raises penalties for the trafficking of children and adolescents to 19 to 20 years of imprisonment. The Government also trained 6,082 officials on child labor issues, and the Ministry of Labor increased its number of labor inspectors from 90 to 97. With support from the World Food Program, the Government continued to expand its school meal program, which now reaches over one million children. However, children in Nicaragua are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. National policies to eliminate child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented, and the Government appears to lack a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor. In addition, the Government has not published national statistics on child labor since 2005.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Niger made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons which will provide protection and social assistance to victims of human trafficking, including children. Law enforcement officials received training on child labor and human trafficking, as well as rescued and assisted 45 children from Koranic teachers that exploited them as street beggars. Further, the Government participated in a new program to combat forced labor. However, children in Niger are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. Laws relating to the worst forms of child labor do not provide adequate coverage and gaps in enforcement have left children unprotected. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Nigeria made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government continues to fund and participate in programs that focus on the prevention and elimination of the worst forms of child labor. Law enforcement officials received child labor training, and the states of Ogun and Oyo approved Action Plans on Child Labor. The Senate and House of Representatives passed a bill to restrict the ability of judges to offer fines in lieu of prison time for human trafficking offenses. However, children in Nigeria are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. The legal framework has inconsistencies regarding child labor, and the minimum age for work is below international standards. Due to budget constraints, the Government did not take actions to implement the 2013 National Action Plan on the Elimination of Child Labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Niue made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Government participated in UNDAF Pacific, which includes youth initiatives related to livelihood opportunities and food security in Niue. While there is no evidence of a child labor problem, the Government has not established adequate legal protection to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Niue&#8217;s Terrorism Suppression and Transnational Crimes Act of 2006 specifically address trafficking in children. There is no law addressing other forms of commercial sexual exploitation of children, nor is there a law prohibiting hazardous work or activities for children. There is no established minimum age for labor, and research has not identified any laws that prohibit the use of children for drug trafficking or other illicit activities.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Norfolk Island made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although research found no evidence that child labor, including its worst forms, exists in Norfolk Island, gaps exist in the legal framework to prevent children from involvement in the worst forms of child labor. Legislation fails to prescribe a minimum age for employment, prohibit hazardous work for children, and fully protect minors under 18 from exploitation in prostitution, which leaves children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Oman made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the Child Law, which prohibits the use of children in illicit activities and raises the minimum age for work and compulsory education to 16. The Government also established a Child Protection Committee to receive complaints related to violations of children&#8217;s rights, including the worst forms of child labor. Although the problem does not appear to be widespread, children are engaged in child labor, including in the agricultural sector in Oman. The Government lacks a policy to address all worst forms of child labor, and information on the enforcement of child labor laws is not publicly available.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Pakistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Federal Government continued to fund and participate in programs to combat child labor, including its worst forms. The Sindh Provincial Government operationalized the Sindh Child Protection Authority and approved the Sindh Education Sector Plan. The Balochistan Provincial Government enacted legislation mandating free and compulsory education for children ages 5 to 16. However, children in Pakistan engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including bonded labor. Provincial Governments have not established a minimum working age, and the federal minimum age for hazardous work falls short of international standards. Not all of Pakistan&#8217;s provinces prohibit human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, and the use of children in illicit activities. Provincial Governments do not have the resources necessary to enforce laws prohibiting child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Panama made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Panama initiated its biennial national child labor survey, created a subcommittee to address the causes of child labor in the province of Bocas del Toro, and expanded the Direct Government Action Program to provide nationwide social and economic services aimed at preventing and eliminating child labor. However, children in Panama are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The law does not adequately define light work and fails to prohibit minors under 16 from engaging in hazardous work within training establishments. Moreover, the law does not clearly sanction violations related to the hazardous work in which children are prohibited to engage.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Papua New Guinea made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government enacted the Criminal Code Amendment Act, which prohibits all forms of human trafficking and establishes penalties for trafficking children. To complement this new legislation, the Department of Justice and the Attorney General (DJAG) worked with the IOM to draft Papua New Guinea&#8217;s first Trafficking in Persons National Action Plan (TiPNAP). The Government also launched an anti-trafficking training program in Port Moresby and seven border provinces to familiarize police officers and other relevant actors with the contents of the new anti-trafficking law and to facilitate its effective enforcement. However, children in Papua New Guinea are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Papua New Guinea does not have legislation to comprehensively prohibit hazardous occupations and activities for children. Additionally, child labor laws are not effectively enforced and the lack of compulsory education may increase the risk of children&#8217;s involvement in the worst forms of child labor. The Government lacks social programs to specifically assist children engaged in child labor in all relevant sectors.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Paraguay made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government strengthened legal protections for incarcerated adolescents by specifying the circumstances and conditions under which they can work in the Penal Implementation Code, included funds in its 2015 budget to hire 40 additional labor inspectors, and established working groups to strengthen coordination among government agencies on child labor issues. In addition, the Government continued to fund conditional cash transfer programs to combat child labor. However, children in Paraguay are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work. Coordination mechanisms among government agencies working to eradicate child labor need strengthening and remain underfunded relative to the scope of the problem. In addition, the Government is unable to provide accurate statistics on whether businesses were fined for child labor infractions because labor inspectors report the fines in aggregate.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Peru made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Peru approved the Intersectoral Protocol against Forced Labor and strengthened the Penal Code&#8217;s penalties for human trafficking. Peru also joined the UNODC Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking and engaged with officials in Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil on child labor issues. The Public Ministry opened a criminal prosecution office in Lima to specialize in human trafficking cases, and the National Labor Inspection Superintendency hired over 90 new labor inspectors and opened 8 regional offices. However, children in Peru continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Peruvian law does not fully comply with international standards to protect children engaged in night work and hazardous work. Labor inspectorates remain underfunded and the number of child labor inspections is insufficient, especially in regions with the highest rates of child labor. In addition, not all Regional Commissions for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor have drafted and funded action plans to combat child labor, although they are mandated to do so.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, the Philippines made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) finalized its Strategic Plan for 2014&#8211;2016, which will serve as the operational framework to address components of the Philippine Program Against Child Labor (PPACL). Four NCLC subcommittees conducted year-end assessments on the accomplishments of their respective 2014 strategic plans to identify the implementation gaps and formulate their 2015 strategic plans under the PPACL Strategic Framework. The Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) trained over 5,000 service providers to ensure the protection, prevention, and prosecution of human trafficking cases, and established three additional regional task forces bringing the countrywide total to 19. However, children in the Philippines are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and domestic work. Despite nearly doubling the number of Labor Law Compliance Officers (LLCO), enforcement of child labor laws remains challenging due to the limited number of inspectors and lack of resources for inspections.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, the Russian Federation made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government committed to assessing and improving working conditions in its 2014 Employment Plan. The Government continued the implementation of a social protection mechanism defined by the Social Contract law to financially support vulnerable citizens, including child trafficking victims. The Government also continued support of the Russian Children in Need Fund, which aims to rehabilitate disadvantaged and homeless children. However, children in Russia are engaged in child labor, including in work on the street, and in the worst forms of child labor, including being used in the production of pornography. Laws do not prohibit possession of child pornography or benefiting from its proceeds. In addition, Russia continues to lack a mechanism to coordinate nationwide efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor, and it has no social programs specifically targeting this goal.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Rwanda made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Rwanda secured funding to continue the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission Child Rehabilitation Program, provided funding for districts to implement child protection programs, created District Steering Committees on Child Labor in all 30 districts, and adopted a national anti-trafficking plan of action. The Government also participates in and implements several additional programs to combat the worst forms of child labor, including child trafficking. However, children in Rwanda are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic service. Gaps exist in the Government&#8217;s enforcement of laws on child labor, and social programs lack adequate safeguards to protect children engaged in domestic service.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan de Cunha made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although no information suggests that the worst forms of child labor are a problem, gaps exist in the legal framework to prevent children from involvement in the worst forms of child labor. The Government lacks legislation prescribing a minimum age for work, and it is unclear whether a list of hazardous occupations exists for children. There are legislative gaps in the prohibition of trafficking of children for labor exploitation and the use of children for commercial sexual exploitation. These gaps make children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Saint Lucia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government ratified the UNC CRC Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict. The Government funded training workshops on human trafficking for Government and NGO officials and continued to fund education initiatives, including after-school programs, transportation subsidies, and school meals. However, although research is limited, children in Saint Lucia are reported to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Saint Lucia also continues to face legislative gaps. The law does not fully protect children from illicit activities, and the Government has not adopted a list of hazardous activities prohibited for children. Further, Saint Lucia has not conducted research to assess the nature and scope of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government participated in the First Meeting of the Working Groups of the XVIII Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor to engage on policies and programs related to child labor and it also continued to implement social programs that target children who may be vulnerable to child labor. However, although the problem does not appear to be widespread, children are engaged in child labor, including in domestic work, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps remain in the legal framework. The minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards; and although the use of children for the trafficking of drugs is prohibited, there is no law to prohibit the use of children in the production of drugs.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Samoa made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed the Occupational Safety and Health Regulations Act that improves the legal framework for identification, assessment, and control of hazards in the workplace. Government ministries also participated in the National Forum on Child Labor, formulating a task force to review legislation related to the enforcement of international child labor conventions. However, children in Samoa are engaged in child labor, including in street vending. The Government lacks legislation that specifically and comprehensively describes the hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children. The law does not define or specify a minimum age for light work. In addition, there was no publicly available information to confirm that criminal law enforcement agencies made efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor, and the Government did not implement any programs to address child labor in the sectors in which it is prevalent.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Senegal made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government convened a tripartite workshop to revise its laws concerning the worst forms of child labor, and the National Task Force Against Trafficking in Persons (CNLTP) designed a national database to collect data on human trafficking. However, children in Senegal continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in forced begging. Senegalese laws do not fully protect children from child labor, and enforcement agencies lack adequate resources to effectively carry out their work. Furthermore, the responsibility for enforcing child labor laws is spread over several ministries, and redundancy among interagency bodies impedes effective implementation of efforts.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Serbia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia published the results of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey for Serbia and for Serbia Roma Settlements, which includes data on the prevalence of child labor in the country. The Government also established 92 child protection teams across the country that provided social services to street children, and 10 new anti-trafficking teams to improve prevention and protection efforts at the local level. However, children in Serbia are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking. Serbia does not have legislation that clearly and comprehensively describes the hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children. The Government also lacks a national policy to combat child labor and a mechanism to effectively coordinate efforts to address child labor across government agencies.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Seychelles made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons Act, which criminalizes all forms of human trafficking and contains provisions to prevent child trafficking and other worst forms of child labor. The Government also adopted the Strategic Framework and National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons, which provides legal protection and social assistance to victims of human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. However, children in Seychelles are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government has not established a minimum age for hazardous work nor has it determined hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for all children. In addition, the Government has not taken sufficient action to protect children from commercial sexual exploitation through social programs.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Sierra Leone made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government ratified the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, and funded and designated some members for the National Commission for Children. The Government also increased the number of labor officers and factory inspectors, and participated in social programs to address child labor and child trafficking. However, children in Sierra Leone continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. Sierra Leone&#8217;s laws do not adequately protect children from involvement in hazardous work and the country does not have an approved national action plan on child labor. During the last half of 2014, the Government had to re-direct most of its resources to address an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Thousands of children became ill or lost parents during the outbreak and schools were closed from June through December.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Solomon Islands made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government enacted the Immigration Act, which prohibits transnational human trafficking and establishes specific penalties for the trafficking of children. Multiagency inspection teams also made site visits to logging camps and fishing areas throughout the country to inspect for human trafficking violations. With technical assistance from the ILO, the Government participated in a Child Labor and Trafficking Forum and a rapid assessment workshop to identify and develop strategies to address the worst forms of child labor in the country. However, children in Solomon Islands are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Education is not compulsory, and laws do not adequately protect all children from hazardous work and commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the Government has not established a body to coordinate efforts to combat child labor, and resources for enforcement are lacking.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Somalia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Federal Government of Somalia ratified ILO C. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, participated in the &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign to prevent the recruitment and use of children by national armed forces, and participated in a program to strengthen the national criminal justice response to trafficking in persons. However, children in Somalia are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. The terrorist organization al-Shabaab remained the main perpetrator of the abduction and use of child soldiers in Somalia. The Somalia National Army also continued to use child soldiers. There are reports that the Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama&#8217;a militia, which has not yet integrated into the Somalia National Security Forces, also used child soldiers. Somalia continued to lack many necessary mechanisms to effectively address the worst forms of child labor, including established labor and criminal law enforcement systems.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, South Africa made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed amendments to the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, which extended protection to children working in the informal sector and increased the penalty for child labor violations from 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The Government also drafted regulations to implement the 2013 Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act. The Government&#8217;s Department of Home Affairs published new regulations for the 2002 Immigration Act that includes new documentation requirements intended to prevent the illegal movement of children. The Government&#8217;s Department of Social Development also implemented a food relief program for households with vulnerable and orphaned children, as well as child-headed households. Studies also indicate that the Government&#39;s Child Support Grant and the Old Age Pension may help reduce child labor. However, children in South Africa are engaged in child labor, including agriculture and domestic work. Government social programs to address child labor do not match the scope of the problem and barriers to education access remain. The Government also does not make enforcement data publicly available.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, South Sudan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but was also complicit in the forced recruitment of children for armed conflict. While the Government made efforts by launching the Children, Not Soldiers campaign to raise awareness about child protection and to penalize perpetrators that recruit child soldiers, South Sudan is receiving this assessment of no advancement because the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army (SPLA) recruited, sometimes forcibly, children to fight the opposition group led by former Vice President Riek Machar. In addition, gaps in legislation continue to put children at risk and child labor laws are not effectively enforced.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Sri Lanka made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government expanded the Child Labor Free District by 2016 program to two new districts. The Government also implemented the fully automated Labor Inspection System Application (LISA) that supports onsite inspection processes in five of nine provinces. However, children in Sri Lanka are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in domestic work. The Government&#8217;s enforcement efforts continued to be weak, particularly with regards to hazardous child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Swaziland made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government paid some school fees for orphans and vulnerable children and also announced plans to cover the fees for the final year of primary school in 2014. However, children in Swaziland are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation and livestock herding as a result of human trafficking. The Government was delinquent in paying school fees in half of the country&#8217;s schools and significant gaps in laws remain, including the lack of a compulsory education age. Additionally, Government officials cited a lack of clarity on the definition of child labor, which hinders their ability to effectively combat the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Thailand made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite political unrest during the year and a military coup in May 2014, the Government took actions to address child labor. Thailand made changes to its legal framework to raise the minimum age for agricultural work from 13 to 15 years, and for work on sea fishing vessels from 16 to 18 years. It also created a national policy committee, including several subcommittees and task forces, to improve policy formulation, interagency coordination, and implementation regarding migrant workers and human trafficking problems. In addition, the Government funded and participated in multiple programs that include the goal of eliminating or preventing child labor, including its worst forms. However, children in Thailand continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the shrimp and seafood processing sector, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Thailand remains weak in its enforcement efforts, particularly in the fishing, agriculture, manufacturing, and home-based business sectors, as well as in the informal sector. The Government also lacks nationwide data on child labor, which impedes the effectiveness of policies and programs.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Timor-Leste made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed a resolution to formally establish the National Commission against Child Labor (NCCL/CNTI) that will coordinate the Government&#8217;s efforts to combat child labor, including its worst forms. In addition, the General Labor Inspectorate Directorate created a new department to deal specifically with child labor issues and hired two additional inspectors. Government officials responsible for the enforcement of child labor laws, including labor inspectors and police officers, participated in numerous trainings on child labor investigation and victim identification procedures. However, children in Timor-Leste are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture. Although the NCCL/CNTI approved a list of hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children, the list has not yet been legally adopted, leaving children vulnerable to engagement in hazardous work.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Togo made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Togo launched a microfinance project that granted loans to 324,000 individuals and implemented a conditional cash transfer project benefitting 214 villages. In addition, 265 primary schools were constructed as part of a World Bank-funded project. However, children in Togo are engaged in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Government has not devoted sufficient resources to effectively enforce its child labor laws. Togo&#8217;s social programs to combat the worst forms of child labor do not match the scope of the problem, and rely largely on NGOs and international organizations for implementation.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Tonga made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government reported training prosecutors, police, and victim service providers on human trafficking issues. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children are engaged in child labor in domestic work. Gaps in the legal framework remain; the country has no laws specifying a minimum age for work or defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Trinidad and Tobago made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government signed the Declaration of the Regional Initiative: Latin America and the Caribbean Free of Child Labor, which includes Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s participation in the regional coordination of child labor elimination strategies. The Government also participated in a regional dialogue on child labor in the First Meeting of the Working Groups of the XVIII Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor. Labor inspectors and rural labor advocates participated in specialized workshops on child trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children. Although the problem does not appear to be widespread, children are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Children&#8217;s Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, which is mandated to protect children&#8217;s rights by the Children&#8217;s Authority Act of 2000 and the Children&#8217;s Authority (Amendment) Act of 2008, is still not fully operational. The Government also has yet to ratify a list of hazardous occupations prohibited for children.</Description>

The Government approved a new Constitution, which includes children&#8217;s rights; began implementing the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking; and launched a new program to improve access to education. However, children in Tunisia are engaged in child labor, including work on the street and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work as a result of human trafficking. A lack of current national-level data on child labor makes it difficult to determine the prevalence and nature of child labor in Tunisia.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Turkey made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Directorate General for Migration Management, a new coordinating body for the implementation of migration law, including laws related to child trafficking and refugee children, began functioning during the reporting period. In addition, together with the EU, the Government funded a project that included the goal of combating child labor by helping parents of working children to find employment. The Government also trained labor inspectors and law enforcement personnel on issues related to child trafficking and hazardous child labor. However, children in Turkey are engaged in child labor in agriculture, including in mobile seasonal work, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government does not have laws that protect children working in agricultural enterprises employing fewer than 50 workers, in small shops employing up to three persons, or in domestic work. In addition, children in the growing Syrian refugee population in Turkey have low access to education and other social services, which leaves them at increased risk of exploitation in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Tuvalu made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government continued to review and revise its labor laws to improve compliance with international standards, including those related to child labor. However, limited evidence suggests that children in Tuvalu are engaged in child labor in fishing. Gaps remain in the Government&#8217;s legislative framework. Children ages 15 to 17 are not protected from work in hazardous environments, and children, particularly boys, are not adequately protected from commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the Government has not collected data to determine the prevalence and nature of the worst forms of child labor in the country to inform policy and program development.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Uganda made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed a law that prohibits child pornography and appointed 10 members to the Industrial Court. It also launched a national child helpline to report cases of child exploitation to district officials and conducted a child labor prevalence study. In addition, the National Council on Children established an inter-ministerial task force to coordinate resource allocation and programming on child labor across ministries. However, children in Uganda are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps in the legal framework persist, such as between compulsory education and minimum working ages, and enforcement information is not made publicly available.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Ukraine made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, Ukraine experienced the election of a new government, armed conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the south and east of the country, and the illegal attempted annexation of Crimea by Russia, which may impact the Government&#8217;s ability to address the worst forms of child labor. The Government partnered with the IOM, the OSCE, and the anti-trafficking NGO La Strada to carry out several awareness-raising campaigns to combat human trafficking. These campaigns were targeted at youth displaced by the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the occupation of Crimea, who are at increased risk of becoming human trafficking victims. The Government also published a report on the efforts made in 2013 to implement the National Program for Combating Human Trafficking Until 2015. However, children in Ukraine are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in pornography. There are no laws or regulations that prohibit possessing child pornography or benefitting from its proceeds, and the age of consent for sexual relationships is not clearly defined. The National Action Plan for Child Protection and the National Program for Combating Human Trafficking remained underfunded in 2014. Furthermore, shelter and rehabilitation centers for children, including street children and victims of human trafficking, are insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Uruguay made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government expanded the National Action Plan to End Child Labor in Garbage Scavenging to include a study of adolescent work in agriculture in rural areas and established the Office of Rural Employment within the Ministry of Labor to work directly with rural communities. The Ministry of Labor hired 20 additional labor inspectors and the Ministry of Interior held a series of workshops to train police, immigration officials, prosecutors, and judges on human trafficking issues. However, children in Uruguay continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in garbage scavenging and commercial sexual exploitation. The Government does not collect or publish information on the number of investigations, prosecutions, and convictions for labor and criminal law violations. Uruguay lacks a comprehensive national child labor policy, and programs to prevent and eliminate child labor are limited.</Description>

		<Advancement_Level>No Advancement - Efforts Made But Complicit</Advancement_Level>
		<Description>In 2014, Uzbekistan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but was also complicit in the use of forced child labor in the cotton sector. While the central Government made concerted efforts to prevent and to remediate forced child labor in cotton production, Uzbekistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because of government complicity in forced child labor, particularly at the local level. Although there was no evidence of a large-scale, centrally-coordinated, forced mobilization of children, some local officials, in more than an isolated incident, continued to mobilize children during the cotton harvest. In committing to end this practice, the Cabinet of Ministers declared its intent to ensure that no one under the age of 18 would participate in the cotton harvest; broadly communicated its new commitment through awareness-raising campaigns to prevent children from being forcibly mobilized to pick cotton; and sponsored after-school programs as an alternative to child labor. The Government also led a monitoring effort utilizing ILO methodology to observe the fall 2014 harvest in all cotton-growing regions of the country, finding 41 child laborers, assessing penalties to 19 school officials and farm managers for the use of child labor, and removing children from the fields. Despite efforts to end the mobilization of children, in the course of widespread mobilization of third-year secondary school students (predominantly age 18) to pick cotton, an unknown number of 17-year-old students were also mobilized through this practice. Independent observers also reported some cases in several provinces in which younger students were mobilized. In a few instances, reports indicate that a local government authority such as a district or regional governing official (hokim) or town mayor may have directly ordered the mobilization of students under age 18. In at least some cases, callers to hotlines for reporting labor violations in the harvest were unable to get through, leaving an important gap in the system for receiving and processing child labor complaints. The Government also maintained policies in the cotton sector that mandate regional harvest quotas and set crop prices at levels that create incentives for local administrators to forcibly mobilize labor, creating an ongoing risk of mobilized child labor. Several observers stated that any reduction in the mobilization of children was offset by an increase in the compulsory mobilization of adult labor, although this trend could not be confirmed. Some of these observers reported surveillance, intimidation, and detention by the local government authorities while attempting to gather information about labor practices in the cotton harvest.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Vanuatu made no advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government continued implementing the National Minimum Standards in Education, a key component of which is child protection. However, limited evidence suggests that children are engaged in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. The law does not establish a minimum age for hazardous work and the law does not prohibit hazardous occupations and activities for children. A mechanism to coordinate government efforts to combat child labor has not been established. Vanuatu does not have any social programs to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Venezuela made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government signed the Declaration of the Regional Initiative: Latin America and the Caribbean Free of Child Labor and maintained policies and programs that aim to alleviate poverty and improve conditions for some working children. However, children in Venezuela continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic service. The Government does not have sufficient efforts in place to protect children in key sectors where child labor is prevalent and does not make information on enforcement efforts publically available. In addition, information is not available on the effectiveness of the Government&#8217;s coordinating body on child labor, and the Government has not established a list of hazardous occupations prohibited for children.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Morocco, which currently controls most of the territory of Western Sahara, made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in Western Sahara. The Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs established a mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor. However, the Government of Morocco does not conduct research on the extent or nature of child labor in Western Sahara or provide specific information on actions carried out in the territory to combat child labor. Evidence suggests that children engage in child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Yemen made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Houthis captured Sana&#8217;a, the capital, in September and established de facto control over the ministries and army. Prior to this, the Government had launched an action plan to end and prevent the recruitment of children by the Yemeni Armed Forces and established a Joint Technical Committee to monitor the action plan&#39;s implementation. The Government also participated in programs that include the goal of eliminating or preventing child labor. However, children in Yemen are engaged in child labor, including in fishing, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. Gaps in laws, enforcement, policies, and programs to combat child labor remain. Non-state armed groups continue to use children in the country&#8217;s internal conflicts. No evidence was found of Government efforts to provide demobilization and rehabilitation services to child soldiers who have been involved in combat.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Zambia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government undertook a massive scale up of its Social Cash Transfer program, adding 125,000 additional households. The Government put into force the Prohibition of Employment of Young Persons and Children (Hazardous Labour) Order. In addition, the Government participates in social programs including two programs to eliminate child labor in tobacco production. However, children in Zambia continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and mining. Gaps remain in the current legal framework related to children; for instance, the Education Act does not include the specific age at which education is compulsory and the Government has not defined what the school-going age is as required in the law, which may leave children under the legal working age vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

		<Description>In 2014, Zimbabwe made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Zimbabwe passed the Trafficking in Persons Act that criminalizes trafficking offenses related to child labor and child pornography. However, children in Zimbabwe continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and mining. Zimbabwe continues to lack specific social programs targeting sectors in which child labor is most prevalent. Gaps remain in the country&#8217;s legal framework against child labor, such as the lack of prohibitions of hazardous activities for children, and education is not compulsory or free, which increases children&#8217;s vulnerability.</Description>
