    <Description>In 2021, Afghanistan made no advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Officials in Afghanistan arrested, detained, and prosecuted children for terrorism-related crimes during the reporting period, including some younger than age 12 who had been forcibly recruited by non-state armed groups. Furthermore, authorities considered some child trafficking victims, especially those engaged in bacha bazi or armed conflict, as criminals, housing them in juvenile detention centers and subjecting them to torture and other forms of ill treatment rather than referring them to victim support services. Children in Afghanistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict, forced labor in the production of bricks and carpets, and commercial sexual exploitation. Afghanistan lacks a mechanism to impose penalties for child labor violations and lacks sufficient programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Afghan law does not sufficiently criminalize forced labor, debt bondage, or the commercial sexual exploitation of girls.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Albania made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created the Ministry of State for Youth and Children, which will play a central role in developing programs to promote the well-being of children in Albania. In addition, the government adopted both the new National Agenda on Children's Rights and the National Strategy on Education. However, children in Albania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in illicit activities and forced begging, and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining, including chromium. Albania's legal framework governing child labor does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities. In addition, Albania’s labor inspectorate does not receive adequate funding to allow for inspections in all sectors in which child labor is known to occur. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Algeria made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Authority for the Protection and Promotion of Children launched an interagency program with the National Social, Economic, and Environmental Council to increase coordination between governmental ministries to study children's needs in Algeria, analyze expenses dedicated to children, and develop a national action plan for children's development. However, children in Algeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street vending. Algerian law does not provide increased penalties for, or categorize as a separate crime, the involvement of children in either the production or trafficking of drugs. Additionally, the government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of work that are hazardous for children to perform. Moreover, while the labor inspectorate is authorized to conduct inspections in all workplaces, inspectors do not investigate unmarked workplaces, such as houses or informal construction sites, without a complaint.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Angola made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved a new National Referral Mechanism for the Protection and Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking and provided trainings on the new mechanism, including victim identification procedures, to law enforcement, border protection, customs and immigration officials, and local human rights committees. Furthermore, it established the Multisectoral Commission on the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor to coordinate efforts to address child labor. It also approved a new National Action Plan to Eradicate Child Labor (2021–2025), and through its Birth Registration and Justice for Children Program, the government approved over $63 million for the purchase of 15 million identification cards and 500 kits to be used to collect biometric and biographic data in order to accelerate its registration of the population. However, children in Angola are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. Laws prohibiting forced labor are not sufficient as they do not criminalize practices similar to slavery or allow for the prosecution of debt bondage. Additionally, the number of labor inspectors does not meet the International Labor Organization's technical advice for the size of Angola's workforce, and social programs do not target all sectors in which  children work.  </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Anguilla, in 2021, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum ages for work and hazardous work do not meet international standards, and Anguilla lacks a list of prohibited hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Argentina made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government conducted and published a study examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and child labor prevalence. It also reported completing more than 50 targeted actions outlined in the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, which included measures to address child pornography. Meanwhile, the national coordination mechanism to eradicate child labor launched an action plan to improve government cooperation with the private sector in addressing child labor. Similarly, the Ministry of Labor enacted a new policy to improve anti-child labor coordination efforts at the sub-national level. However, children in Argentina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the transport, sale, and distribution of drugs. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture. Moreover, the government does not publish complete information about its labor law enforcement efforts and the labor inspectorate remains understaffed to adequately address child labor issues in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Armenia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government nearly doubled the staffing of their labor inspectorate from 27 inspectors to 50, with additional funding and intentions to hire more than 90 inspectors in the near future. The Health and Labor Inspection Body also held regular trainings for inspectors around the country and entered into an agreement with the Agricultural University to train students on labor issues, including child labor and human trafficking. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Armenia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law that delays advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Labor inspectors still lack the authority to conduct unannounced inspections, despite receiving additional authority in 2021. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Children in Armenia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. The government does not routinely collect or maintain official data on child labor. In addition, the minimum age for work does not meet international standards because labor legislation does not apply to children working in the informal sector. Lastly, the laws criminalizing commercial sexual exploitation of children are insufficient because they do not explicitly criminalize those engaging in commercial sex involving children.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Azerbaijan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its provision of training to address human trafficking and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population began developing a new Decent Work Country Program in conjunction with the International Labor Organization. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it has not rescinded a law that delays advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In 2017, the government extended a moratorium on labor inspections, including worksite inspections, until 2021. During the reporting period, the moratorium was then extended through January 1, 2023. There was no indication of when onsite inspections would resume, and while inspectors can conduct desk reviews in response to complaints, this lack of proactive or onsite inspection mechanisms may leave potential violations of child labor laws undetected in workplaces. Children in Azerbaijan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Coordinating bodies, including the State Committee on Family, Women and Children's Affairs, lack the capacity to effectively carry out their mandates. In addition, police often treat children forced to beg or engage in street work as a family issue, leading to some cases not being properly referred for criminal investigation and prosecution; however, police took initial steps in 2021 to identify child victims of forced begging and refer them to local shelters for assistance.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Bangladesh made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In early 2022, the government ratified International Labor Organization Convention No. 138: Convention Concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and the International Labor Organization Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention. The government also removed 5,088 children in vulnerable situations from 23 districts through labor inspections. However, children in Bangladesh are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor in drying of fish and the production of bricks. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of garments and leather goods. The Bangladesh Labor Act does not apply to the informal sector, in which most child labor in Bangladesh occurs. In addition, penalties for child labor violations can only be imposed after a lengthy legal process and, when courts do impose them, the fines are too low to deter child labor law violations. Moreover, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts related to child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Belize made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed Belize's second National Child Labor Policy with plans to begin implementation in 2022. It also launched a program with the ILO and the Belize Sugarcane Farmers Association to pilot strategies to promote employment for vulnerable youth and women in the sugarcane supply chain in northern Belize. In addition, Belize achieved its first two convictions under the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Act. However, children in Belize are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture and construction. Belize does not meet the international standard for prohibitions of hazardous work because children over age 14 are permitted to work in dangerous activities such as mining, manufacturing, and construction. In addition, the minimum age for work is lower than the compulsory education age, which may encourage children to leave school before the completion of compulsory education.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Benin made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Social Affairs removed 400 children from child labor as a result of social services inspections. In addition, the Administrative Census for Population Identification registered citizens without identity documents, and the Government of Benin streamlined processes for birth registration. However, children in Benin are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of cotton and crushed granite, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work and street vending. There are many barriers to education, especially for children with disabilities. In addition, the government did not publicly release information on some of its criminal law enforcement efforts, and limited resources for the adequate enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Bhutan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Commission for Women and Children developed a Standard Operating Procedure for children in difficult circumstances. The commission also launched a mobile application that allows people to report violations against women and children, including child labor violations, and connects citizens to the national helpline. However, children in Bhutan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, as a result of trafficking and forced domestic work and care-giving. Bhutan’s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards, and education is not compulsory. The government has not adopted a national policy to address child labor, including its worst forms. The government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Bolivia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a decree giving migrants the ability to normalize their status without paying fines, helping enroll more children in school. However, children in Bolivia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production and harvesting of Brazil nuts. Although Bolivian law requires that apprentices attend school, it does not set a minimum age for participation in apprenticeships. In addition, Article 1 of Supreme Decree No. 1875 sets the minimum age for compulsory military service at 17, which does not comply with international standards. The government also did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Bosnia and Herzegovina made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Republika Srpska National Assembly adopted amendments to its Criminal Code to include three new categories of exploitation—servitude, forced begging, and additional forms of sexual exploitation—and introduced higher penalties for trafficking children. Additionally, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Council of Ministers adopted a national-level action plan to facilitate implementation of the Strategy to Suppress Trafficking in Human Beings in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2020–2023). However, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Social programs dedicated to assisting children involved in forced begging do not have adequate resources, and representatives from the Ministries of Labor are not included in the National Anti-Trafficking Strike Force, which limits coordination efforts. Furthermore, laws on the minimum age for work do not meet international standards because they do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside of formal employment relationships.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Botswana made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government secured a conviction and imposed a 10-year sentence on an individual for forced labor of a child in domestic servitude. However, children in Botswana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in cattle herding and domestic service. Key gaps remain in the country’s legal framework, including the lack of a minimum age for compulsory education and a list of hazardous work activities for children. The government did not provide information on its labor law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. In addition, social programs do not always reach children in child labor, especially those engaged in cattle herding and domestic work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Brazil made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published two updated versions of the national "Dirty List" containing information on employers that the Ministry of Labor and Welfare found to be using slave labor, including that of children. It also established the Intersectoral Commission to Combat Violence Against Children and Adolescents, with the aim of consolidating public policies relevant to addressing all types of violence against children and adolescents. Furthermore, the government updated the Federal Pact for the Eradication of Forced Labor, with the objective of promoting, improving, and maximizing communication between entities involved in addressing slave labor and extending participation to all 5,000 municipalities in the country. Lastly, the Ministry of Citizenship's Monitoring System of the Child Labor Eradication Program, which tracks actions taken by state and municipal governments in support of the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor, registered 12,756 activities carried out nationwide to address child labor. However, children in Brazil are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Although Brazil made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions against child trafficking require the use of threats, violence, coercion, fraud, or abuse to be established for the crime of child trafficking and, therefore, do not meet international labor standards. The reported number of labor inspectors is likely not sufficient to provide adequate coverage of the workforce, and local governments lack the capacity to fully implement and monitor the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor and other social protection programs.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the British Virgin Islands, in 2021, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. There is no list of hazardous work prohibited for children in the British Virgin Islands, nor does the law prohibit the use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum age for work is lower than the compulsory education age.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Burkina Faso made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed an implementation plan for the National Strategy to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labor for the period of 2022 to 2023. It also signed a memorandum of understanding with Nigeria to address human trafficking and completed a national child labor survey. However, children in Burkina Faso are subjected to the worst forms of child labor,  including in farming and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in artisanal gold mining. The Labor Code does not identify the activities in which children may engage in light work. The government also lacked resources for the enforcement of child labor laws and did not release information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement. On February 1, 2021, the Burma military launched a coup and seized control of the state from the democratically elected civilian government. The return of a military regime and the resulting instability severely impact the ability of the Burma to fully engage in addressing the worst forms of child labor throughout the country. Burma is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated a practice of being complicit in the use of forced child labor in more than isolated incidents. The national military continued to force civilians, including children, to work in non-combat roles as porters, cleaners, cooks, and agricultural laborers in conflict areas, including Rakhine, during the reporting period. While Burma took at least one step to address child labor--the drafting of a hazardous work list for children--the list was not published during the reporting period. Children in Burma are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The vulnerability of Rohingya children to the worst forms of child labor remained high as many continued to be denied access to education and livelihoods because of regime restrictions on their movements. Penalties for recruitment and use of children by the military, or for the military’s use of civilian populations for forced labor, are also not sufficient for the seriousness of the crime. In addition, the regime did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement efforts. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Burundi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Burundi developed its first ever data management system to track human trafficking cases and passed a new migration law intended to permit official intervention in cases of international trafficking in persons. The government also established a permanent commission to coordinate anti-trafficking in persons efforts. However, children in Burundi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Burundi lacks a compulsory education age that is equal to the minimum age for work, and the government failed to provide comprehensive criminal law enforcement data related to the worst forms of child labor. Other challenges remain, including a lack of resources to conduct labor inspections and criminal investigations; a lack of well-trained educators and poor infrastructure in the education sector; and insufficient social programs to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Cabo Verde made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure to increase penalties for sexual crimes committed against children, notably those between the ages of 14 and 16. These amendments also increase penalties by one-third in situations involving family relationships or guardianships, and attribute accountability not only to perpetrators but also to those who assist in the victimization of children. In addition, the Cabo Verdean Institute for Children and Adolescents launched a program to ensure that children remain in school and stay off the streets. Furthermore, a National Plan to Prevent and Combat Sexual Violence Against Children and Adolescents, along with a National Communications Strategy for the Prevention and Combat of Sexual Violence were approved. In 2021, Maio Island recorded zero cases of child labor after having recorded the highest number of cases in the country during the previous reporting period, due to extensive awareness-raising efforts conducted throughout the island and increased collaboration between relevant agencies. However, children in Cabo Verde are subjected to the worst forms of  child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Laws prohibiting forced labor are not sufficient as they do not criminalize practices similar to slavery or debt bondage and forced or compulsory labor. In addition, communication among law enforcement agencies is limited and social programs to assist children involved in agriculture and domestic work are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Cambodia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched its first five-year National Action Plan to Prevent and Respond to Online Child Sexual Exploitation (2021-2025). The government also held campaigns and workshops to raise awareness about child labor and gender equity in the freshwater fishing sector. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Cambodia is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued practices that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to take active measures to investigate, prosecute, convict, and sentence public officials who participate in or facilitate the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation of children and debt-based forced labor in brick kilns. In addition, judges were reported to have accepted bribes in return for dismissal of charges, acquittal, and reduced sentencing for individuals committing such crimes, especially for those with alleged ties to the government. Children in Cambodia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced labor in brickmaking. In addition, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Cameroon made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the "Zero Children in Gold Mines" program to address child labor in the gold mining sector. The government also convened meetings at the level of the technical secretariat for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Trafficking in Persons, where it adopted an Operational Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants. However, children in Cameroon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in the recruitment by non-state armed groups for use in conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cocoa production and gold mining. In addition, the government has not addressed gaps in Cameroon's legal framework regarding the prohibition of use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs, and the prohibition of the recruitment of children under age 18 by non-state armed groups. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, the Central African Republic made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Parliament passed legislation authorizing the ratification of the International Labor Organization Convention 190 on Violence and Harassment, which reaffirms the fundamental principles and rights at work, including the effective abolition of child labor. The government also created an alert system for reporting child labor violations. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Central African Republic is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it implemented a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Government security forces recruited children for support roles and coordinated with an armed group that recruited and used children in armed conflict. Children in the Central African Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use in armed conflict and forced labor in diamond mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic work. Other gaps remain, as the Central African Republic does not meet the international standard for minimum age protections since the law does not cover children working in the informal sector.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Chad made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created a National Referral Mechanism that outlines standard operating procedures for suspected cases of trafficking in persons, including those involving children. In addition, the government created a Multi-sectoral Technical Committee Against Migrant Smuggling and Human Trafficking and with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration, provided training on trafficking in persons to judicial officials. However, children in Chad are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in cattle herding and domestic work. In addition, the government did not provide sufficient data on law enforcement efforts and has no active policies to address child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Chile made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Following Chile's ratification of the International Labor Organization's Protocol on Forced Labor, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare created the Ministerial Advisory Commission to strengthen Chile's efforts to address forced labor among adults and children. Civil servants, police officers, and detectives were also trained on human trafficking victim assistance, including videotaped investigative interviewing. In addition, the National Tourism Service established an interagency alliance with the Undersecretary of Labor's Department of Child Labor Eradication and Inter-Agency Task Force on Trafficking in Persons to organize workshops with business owners on awareness and prevention of child labor, commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, and trafficking in persons in the tourism sector. However, children in Chile are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children are also subjected to involvement in the production and trafficking of drugs. Furthermore, prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Colombia made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Penal Code, increasing penalties for aggravating factors in crimes of human smuggling and trafficking involving children. The Ministry of Labor also adopted a "Guide for the Identification of Possible Cases of Trafficking in Persons for the Purpose of Forced Labor" to help labor inspectors identify forced labor crimes. The Intersectoral Commission for the Prevention of the Recruitment and Use of Children by Illegal Armed Groups published an extensive report analyzing the incidence and patters of the recruitment, use, and sexual violence against children carried out by illegal armed and criminal groups for the 2016–2020 period. The Ministry of the Interior also developed and implemented the national trafficking in persons prevention plan "Zero Complicity," which focused on strengthening trafficking prevention efforts and includes a public awareness campaign. In addition, the government introduced the "Katunaa Modality" social program designed to protect the fundamental rights of children ages 6 to 13, including with regard to child labor, sexual violence, and intra-family violence. However, children in Colombia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government does not employ a sufficient number of labor inspectors. Research also indicates that existing social programs are insufficient to address the scope of the worst forms of child labor in Colombia.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Comoros made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Comoros ratified the Forced Labor Protocol, which commits the country to taking effective measures to prevent forced labor, protect victims, and ensure victim access to judicial recourse. The government also modified its Penal Code to increase penalties for the use of children in drug trafficking and opened a new center in Grand Comore for vulnerable and abused children. However, children in Comoros are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. Comoros' Labor Code only applies to workers with a formal work agreement, leaving child laborers, particularly those in the informal sector, vulnerable to exploitation. In addition, the legal framework defines child trafficking as requiring the use of force, fraud, or coercion, which does not conform with international standards. Finally, Comoros lacks a national action plan to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government allocated 40 percent of the national budget to primary education. The National Action Plan to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labor was extended to 2025. In addition, First Lady Denise Nyakeru Tshisekedi, in collaboration with the National Committee to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labor and World Vision, hosted an advocacy workshop on combating child labor. However, children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, cobalt ore (heterogenite), tin ore (cassiterite), tantalum ore (coltan), and tungsten ore (wolframite), and are used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups. Children also mine cobalt ore (heterogenite) in the Copperbelt region. The government did not publish labor or criminal law enforcement data. It also failed to take active measures to ensure that children are not inappropriately incarcerated, penalized, or physically harmed solely for unlawful acts as a direct result of being a survivor of the worst forms of child labor. Other gaps remain, including a lack of enforcement personnel, insufficient training for enforcement personnel, limited financial resources, and poor coordination of government efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, the Republic of the Congo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government conducted its first-ever nationwide child labor survey in coordination with the United Nations Children's Fund. The government also renewed a bilateral agreement with the Democratic Republic of the Congo that formalized regular bilateral collaboration to support trafficking victims and share information on suspected traffickers. In addition, the implementation of ministerial decrees aimed at protecting indigenous peoples' rights continued to result in an increase in the number of indigenous children enrolled in the school system. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. The government has yet to accede to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, and existing programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor in all relevant sectors. In addition, the country lacks a national policy to address child labor. </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Cook Islands, in 2021, the government made moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government approved the new National Youth Policy for 2021–2026 and opened its first Youth Hub for children, which will connect youth groups across the country in order to empower young people in their communities. Additionally, the Ministry of Internal Affairs collaborated with the United Nations Children's Fund Pacific office to draft a comprehensive report on its cash transfer program, which in part seeks to provide support to families with young children. However, the law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Costa Rica made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Statistics Institute published a new household survey that included a child labor component measuring labor rates for children between the ages of 12 and 17. Furthermore, the government drafted and enacted new national action plans to combat child labor and human trafficking. Costa Rica also drafted a law to address migrant smuggling in an effort to address human trafficking, and drafted modifications to its trafficking laws. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Labor implemented a new guide to assist businesses in confronting child labor. However, children in Costa Rica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Furthermore, the labor inspectorate lacks a sufficient number of inspectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Côte d’Ivoire made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ivoirian government eliminated school fees in January 2021 and increased the number of labor inspectors by 10 percent. The government also hired 150 field staff to support labor inspectors in cocoa farming zones and drafted a new National Sustainable Cocoa Strategy to Fight Deforestation, Child Labor, and Low Farmer Incomes in the cocoa sector. In addition, the First Lady and Head of the National Committee for Surveillance inaugurated a third center for survivors of trafficking, exploitation, and child labor located in Ferkessédougou. However, children in Côte d’Ivoire are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee. The government does not have a mechanism to assess civil penalties for labor law violations and the lack of financial resources and personnel may have hindered labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Djibouti made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor began discussions with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women and Families about the creation of a formal mechanism to refer children found in child labor to appropriate social services. In addition, the labor inspectorate targeted inspections in the restaurant and construction sectors, in which child labor is believed to be more prevalent. However, children in Djibouti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in street work. Minimum age provisions apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards. In addition, the government did not make adequate efforts to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor due to lack of financial and human resource allocations and reporting mechanisms. Finally, the government did not publish data on labor law or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Dominica, in 2021, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government funded and participated in programs that may contribute to preventing child labor, including a program that improved school infrastructure and others that provided meals to students. However, Dominica's legal framework does not protect children from exploitative work outside of the school year, and the government has not determined the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. During the reporting period, the government did not respond to requests for information related to its efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, the Dominican Republic made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Directorate of Policies for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor hired 23 child labor specialists to work in the offices of the Local Labor Representations in the interior of the country. The Dominican Municipal League, the Dominican Federation of Municipalities, and the Ministry of Labor also undertook a new inter-institutional cooperation agreement to develop awareness and training programs for municipal government personnel to integrate local governments in the efforts to address child labor throughout the country. Additionally, the government prepared a labor inspection manual to provide guidance to labor inspectors on the actions they should take while carrying out labor inspections. However, children in the Dominican Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain, including limited human and financial resources for the enforcement of child labor laws, including a lack of a sufficient number of labor inspectors and criminal investigators, and adequate facilities, transportation, and fuel. Labor inspectors also lack the authority to assess penalties for labor law violations, including those related to child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Ecuador made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Attorney General's Office trained over 2,000 prosecutors and administrative staff on sexual crimes against minors and trafficking in persons. The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Social and Economic Inclusion developed inspection plans in the agricultural sector in rural areas, a sector that had previously been lacking in inspections, and worked with their counterparts in Colombia to establish mechanisms to address child labor in the illegal mining sector along the Ecuador-Colombia border. Under the National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, the government held various anti-trafficking trainings for labor inspectors, prosecutors, and police officers, among others. In addition, the Business Network for a Child Labor-Free Ecuador—a public-private partnership helmed by the Ministry of Labor—also continued its work with 73 business entities, focusing on child labor issues in the priority sectors of bananas, flowers, fishing, and mining. However, children in Ecuador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Although the government continued efforts to eradicate child labor, the National Project to Eradicate Child Labor formally ended in December 2021 and a replacement program or institutional body has not been identified.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Egypt made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Prosecutor General’s Office announced the opening of eight specialized prosecution offices to combat human trafficking and illegal migration crimes nationwide. Additionally, 121 new trafficking investigations involving forced child begging were opened as a result of Ministry of Interior campaigns to combat child exploitation. The Egyptian Senate's Manpower Committee also submitted a draft labor law to the Speaker of the Senate for review. A separate proposed amendment would also allow the government to fine business owners 1,000 to 2,000 Egyptian pounds (64 to 128 USD) for violating the minimum age provisions, with double the fine for repeat offenses, and subject the business to the possibility of forced closure for up to 6 months. However, children in Egypt are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in quarrying limestone. The government did not publish data on the enforcement of child labor laws, and programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, El Salvador made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Education invested over $53 million to purchase computers that benefited 120,092 students and 12,000 teachers in the country. The government signed a cooperation agreement with the governments of Honduras and Guatemala to strengthen coordination and efforts to address trafficking in persons. The government also published results from its annual multipurpose household survey, which identifies child labor prevalence in the country. However, children in El Salvador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and in illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of coffee. Law enforcement agencies continue to lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws throughout the country. Gaps also remain related to the lack of publicly available, comprehensive information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Finally, social programs do not adequately address the full scope of the child labor problem in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Eritrea is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. Government officials continued to force students in grade 12, some whom are under the age of 18, to participate in military training elements of the government's compulsory national service program. Otherwise, the government made efforts by maintaining its Child Wellbeing Committees. Children in Eritrea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced military training associated with national service and forced agricultural labor. Moreover, Eritrea's minimum age protections do not apply to children working outside formal employment relationships, and therefore do not conform to international standards. In addition, the government does not have a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Eswatini made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Eswatini launched a National Action Plan on the Elimination of Child Labor and created an interagency task force to oversee its implementation. The Deputy Prime Minister (DPM)’s office, which oversees child welfare, launched a campaign to ensure that children in Eswatini are issued identity documents, which will help orphaned and vulnerable children gain a greater access to education. However, children in Eswatini are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, forced livestock herding, and commercial sexual exploitation. Significant gaps in the legal framework remain, including gaps in minimum age protections, a lack of legislation regulating the labor conditions under Kuhlehla and other customary practices, and a de facto compulsory education age that does not meet international standards. In addition, minimum age protections only apply to children working in industrial undertakings, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age to work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Ethiopia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government established a new National Action Plan to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2021–2025). The Ministry of Labor and Skills, together with the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions and Confederation of Ethiopian Employers Federation also launched the Decent Work Country Program (2021–2025). In addition, the government significantly increased the operating budget of the labor inspectorate. However, children in Ethiopia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and in commercial sexual exploitation. The law in Ethiopia does not include free basic education or a compulsory age for education, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to address child labor have also not sufficiently targeted sectors with high incidences of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), in 2021, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Safeguarding Children’s Board met quarterly and hosted trainings on safeguarding children, including understanding child sexual exploitation. However, the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) are assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to prevent child labor. There is no functioning labor inspectorate in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) to enforce labor laws. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the minimum ages for work and for hazardous work do not meet international standards, and the law does not prohibit adults from using, procuring, and offering a child for the production and trafficking of drugs. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Fiji made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. In addition, the government launched the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and accompanying strategy and allocated financial and human resources to implement it. However, children in Fiji are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Fiji's light work provisions are not specific enough to prevent children from being involved in child labor. In addition, social programs undertaken by the government are insufficient to support children vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and forced domestic work. The government did not provide information on its labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Gabon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, authorities removed more than 30 children from exploitive settings and provided them with government services. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Gabon is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to provide evidence it conducted worksite inspections during the reporting period. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Gabon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. Gabonese law regarding minimum age for work provisions only applies to children in formal employment relationships, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age for work. In addition, labor inspectors lack the basic resources necessary to conduct investigations. Finally, Gabon does not have a policy that addresses all relevant forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, The Gambia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new National Action Plan Against Trafficking in Persons, and it launched the National Referral Mechanism for the Protection of Vulnerable Migrants, including the Victims of Trafficking. However, children in The Gambia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Gaps in the law remain, including that the minimum age for work is higher than the age of compulsory education. Although the government has adopted various policies addressing human trafficking, research found no evidence of a policy on other worst forms of child labor. In addition, labor inspectors do not inspect private homes or farms where children may be working.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Georgia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government doubled the budget for the Labor Inspectorate, significantly increased its number of labor inspectors, and approved a new National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons (2021–2022). The Public Defender's Office also published a report on the status of child labor as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a new mobile group was created to identify and assist children living and working on the streets in Adjara. However, children in Georgia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced begging. Children also engage in agricultural labor. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, Georgia's minimum age for work does not meet international standards because it does not apply to the informal sector. In addition, the Criminal Code does not explicitly prohibit the use of children in illicit activities. Furthermore, the compulsory education age leaves children who are 15 years of age vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor, because they are not required to be in school but are not legally permitted to work full time.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Ghana made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed a Public-Private Partnership framework to address child labor in the cocoa industry after the expiration of the Harkin-Engel Protocol. The government also drafted a new national plan of action to eliminate human trafficking, and the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection developed a communications strategy to guide outreach efforts on human trafficking issues for the years 2022–2026. However, children in Ghana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in fishing and cocoa production and harvesting. Prohibitions related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards because, while Ghana does criminally prohibit the use, procuring, and offering of a child for electronic performances, the law does not extend to live performances. The law also does not prohibit the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the government has not acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. Lastly, resource constraints severely limited the government's ability to adequately enforce labor laws and implement social programs during the reporting period.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Grenada made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Grenada, no official study of child labor has been done to confirm this. The government's ability to prevent children from being subjected to the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition, the government has not published data on labor inspectorate funding.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Guatemala made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established Mobile Units for the Prevention of Sexual Violence, Exploitation, and Human Trafficking Program in order to provide services and raise awareness on human trafficking in rural and remote communities. The Public Ministry also opened two new regional prosecutor's offices that will prosecute cases related to trafficking in persons, expanding access to justice for victims. Furthermore, the government amended legislation to increase the reach and budget of the school feeding program by 57 percent, making it available to all students enrolled in public school. Together with UNICEF and Survivors' Foundation, the government launched three new tools aimed at protecting children online. Moreover, Guatemala signed a cooperation agreement with the governments of El Salvador and Honduras to strengthen efforts against trafficking in persons. However, children in Guatemala are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. An insufficient number of labor inspectors and resources limited the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare's ability to combat child labor. In addition, existing social programs are insufficient to reach all children engaged in exploitative labor and, in particular, do not target children engaged in domestic work or agriculture.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Guinea made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. For the first time, it provided a dedicated budget for the National Committee to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Similar Practices and set up a national hotline to report violations, including those related to labor and trafficking in persons. The government also issued an Emergency Action Plan, as a supplement to the 2020–2022 National Action Plan for Trafficking in Persons, to address the 11 priority recommendations highlighted in the 2021 U.S. Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report. However, children in Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in artisanal mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. The government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. Laws related to the minimum age for work also do not meet international standards because they do not include children working outside of a formal employment relationship and children who are self-employed. In addition, the government does not implement sufficient social programs to address the extent of the child labor problem. On September 5th, the military launched a coup, seized control of the state, and dissolved the Constitution. The coup and the resulting changes in government likely impacted the ability of the Government of Guinea to fully engage in addressing the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Guinea-Bissau made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government finalized the Code of Integral Child Protection, which aims to harmonize child protection laws, including child labor laws, and serve as a comprehensive national regulation on the protection of children's rights. The National Institute for Women and Children collaborated with the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations Children's Fund, and other partners to develop a legal framework and policies necessary for the implementation of the Code of Integral Child Protection, and provided training and awareness raising related to the new code to community leaders. In addition, the Institute identified and assisted 92 child victims of forced begging and 33 suspected child victims of sexual exploitation. However, children in Guinea-Bissau are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Guinea-Bissau’s legal framework does not sufficiently prohibit the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the minimum age for work is not in compliance with international standards since the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children without a work contract. Furthermore, law enforcement officials do not receive sufficient training and resources to adequately conduct inspections and prosecute cases of child labor, and social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Guyana made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its number of inspectors from 17 to 22, exceeding the International Labor Organization's recommendation of 19 inspectors. Guyana also added $250,000 to the country's national budget to fund a shelter that serves adults and children who are survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking. However, children in Guyana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Guyana does not meet the international standard for hazardous work for children because it allows children ages 16 to 17 to conduct night work in industrial activities. In addition, law enforcement agencies have insufficient resources to conduct inspections in remote areas, including a lack of transportation and accommodation. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Haiti made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted standard operating procedures that aim to coordinate the identification, aid, and reintegration of survivors of human trafficking, including children. However, children in Haiti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and domestic work. Minimum age protections for work apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards requiring all children to be protected. In addition, Haiti lacks a clear minimum age for domestic work and a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. Likewise, labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties and social programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Honduras made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a new legal protocol to improve local community coordination on child labor issues and increased penalties for forced labor under the Penal Code from five to eight years’ imprisonment to 10 to 15 years. The government also established the Roadmap for the Elimination of Child Labor in Honduras (2021-2025), which seeks to identify risk factors for vulnerability to child labor, raise awareness of child labor laws, and establish a protocol for responding to child labor violations. Furthermore, government agencies conducted multiple joint inspections targeting child labor throughout the country, and the Ministry of Education launched a new learning management system to address gaps in education caused by the pandemic. However, children in Honduras are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. They are also used to carry out illicit activities, including selling and trafficking drugs. Children also engage in child labor in the production of coffee, melons, and lobsters. Labor law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandate. Additionally, social programs that address child labor in agriculture have not addressed the problem nationwide. The government also lacks similar programs to eliminate child labor in other sectors, including fishing, mining, domestic work, and forced begging.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, India made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The State Government of Bihar issued the biggest recorded payout to survivors of the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, which involved the victimization of 44 girls between the ages of 7 and 17 for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, Indian authorities rescued 58,289 children from child labor during 2020-2021, an increase from previous years. In July 2021, the Anti-Human Trafficking Units in Telangana also rescued more than 2,500 children from child labor and streamlined the state's trafficking prevention and rehabilitation processes. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcement efforts. Children in India are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in garment production, stone quarrying, and brickmaking. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work for long periods in unsafe and unhealthy environments, and penalties for employing children are insufficient to deter violations. There are also serious concerns about widespread corruption among police and other government officials related to the enforcement of child labor crimes, actively impeding the investigation and prosecution of such offenses, and mistreating victims. In addition, children continue to be abused in shelter homes that operate without sufficient government oversight or accountability.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Indonesia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection launched a hotline to connect with child labor or child trafficking survivors requiring outreach, case management, shelter, mediation, and victim services. The government also issued Regulation No. 78/2021 on the Special Protection on Children, which requires the central and regional governments to provide comprehensive protection to children who are survivors of the worst forms of child labor, as well as children from minority groups and with disabilities. In addition, the Ministry of Manpower employed 1,503 labor inspectors in 2021, up from 1,352 labor inspectors in 2020. However, children in Indonesia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in plantation agriculture, including in palm oil and tobacco production. The Ministry of Manpower continued to lack the financial resources and personnel necessary to fully enforce child labor laws throughout the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Iraq made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2021, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs launched a campaign with the International Labor Organization to raise awareness about child labor among students, families, and employers of sectors where child labor is present. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Iraq is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government authorities In 2021 may have inappropriately detained or punished children allegedly affiliated with ISIS—some of whom were victims of forcible recruitment and use. Children in Iraq are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. The government did not provide information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. It also continues to lack programs that focus on assisting children involved in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Jamaica made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended its Trafficking in Persons Act by removing the option of fines as punishment for certain severe offenses, such as commercial sexual exploitation of children, and increasing the maximum fine for other offenses. It also launched a 211 hotline to replace the previous 888-PROTECT line, making it easier for the public to report child labor cases. Moreover, 150 justices were trained on how to identify and report suspected cases of trafficking, including child trafficking and child labor violations. However, children in Jamaica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and use in illicit activities. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and street work. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, its laws do not provide higher penalties for using, procuring, or offering children for the production and distribution of drugs than penalties imposed for these same crimes when the victims are adults. Moreover, the number of labor inspectors is insufficient for the size of Jamaica's workforce. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Jordan made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted several amendments to the Law on the Prevention of Human Trafficking, including adding organized begging to the categories of trafficking crimes, and launched a new website for the public to submit labor complaints, which includes a dedicated channel for child soldiers. The government also amended the National Framework to Combat Child Labor to reflect the Ministry of Social Development's responsibility to protect working children as specified in Juvenile Law No. 32 of 2014. Additionally, it established a new program—Addressing the Worst Forms of Child Labor in the Agriculture Sector—that aims to reduce child labor in agriculture in rural and remote parts of Mafraq and the Jordan Valley. Moreover, the government formed an interagency committee to update the National Strategy to Combat Child Labor; the committee met six times and agreed on a draft updated strategy. However, children in Jordan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Moreover, Syrian children still face barriers to accessing education due to socioeconomic pressures, bullying, and the costs associated with transportation and supplies, among other issues. In addition, the scope of government programs is insufficient to fully address the extent of child labor, including in construction and street vending.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Kazakhstan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved dedicated funding for agencies to address the trafficking of children, increased penalties for sex crimes against children, and included child labor identifiers on labor inspection checklists. In addition, it adopted a new national action plan to combat trafficking in persons for 2021–2023 and published a number of reports on current action plans to address human trafficking and child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Kazakhstan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it implemented a law that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. On December 30, 2021, the President of Kazakhstan signed a law significantly restricting the circumstances under which unannounced inspections can be performed. The new law, which will come into effect on January 1, 2023, codifies and expands the government’s existing practice since January 2020. Under the newly revised Entrepreneurial Code, unannounced inspections will be prohibited in all cases except in the presence of compelling grounds and supporting evidence enclosed to such a complaint, or if an inspection is mandated by judicial or tax authorities. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Children in Kazakhstan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in markets. The government lacks current, comprehensive, and detailed research on child labor, including in cotton production. In addition, labor inspections of small enterprises are permitted only in cases that pose a mass threat to life and health, law and social order, or national security.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Kenya made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Local child labor officers in Nairobi facilitated trainings for police officers and users of the court system related to key laws protecting children from the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the government published updated information on child labor prevalence in Kenya. However, Kenya is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Elements within the Kenyan Defense Forces provided various forms of in-kind support--including harboring, training, intelligence-gathering, and payment of salaries--to a Somali federal member state that is strongly implicated in the recruitment and use of child soldiers. Children in Kenya are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic service. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Key coordinating committees related to elimination of child labor lack adequate resources to carry out their mandates and the labor inspectorate does not have sufficient financial and human resources, affecting its ability, to ensure that child labor laws are enforced.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Kiribati made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government funded a pilot program to conduct child labor inspections and collect data on the nature of child labor. The government also provided data on labor law enforcement and criminal law enforcement efforts in 2021. Additionally, the government finalized and endorsed an interagency referral pathway that strengthens child protection case management. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Kiribati are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Existing laws do not identify hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Kosovo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted two administrative instructions to facilitate implementation of the new Law on Child Protection, and law enforcement agencies made use of new technologies developed specifically to track child labor cases. Government entities and civil society organizations also participated in trainings on juvenile justice and social protection for vulnerable youth, and the government continued to support a number of social programs for at-risk children. However, children in Kosovo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work, including begging and loading and transporting goods. The Labor Inspectorate and Centers for Social Work face financial and human resource constraints, which may impede their ability to adequately address child labor. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, the Kyrgyz Republic made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The President of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a decree to improve children's access to and the quality of primary and secondary education. The Ministry of Labor, Social Development, and Migration and the Ministry of Internal Affairs also continued development of the 2022–2025 National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and in December 2021, finalized and sent it to the Cabinet of Ministers for review and consideration for adoption. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Kyrgyz Republic is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a law and practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Although the government's moratorium on labor inspections expired on January 1, 2022, the moratorium remained in place throughout 2021. The government amended this moratorium in 2020 to permit labor inspections based on formal complaints; however, the Ministry of Economy was required to approve worksite visits associated with such inspections, and in practice, it announced these visits in advance. The restrictions placed on unannounced inspections may have allowed potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses to go undetected in workplaces. The COVID-19 pandemic and a large-scale reorganization of government ministries further restricted the government's ability to address child labor issues. The government did not provide complete information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. Children in the Kyrgyz Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Protections to children granted in the Labor Code, such as the minimum age of employment, are not extended to children engaged in non-contractual employment, and research indicated that labor law enforcement efforts are not targeted to all sectors in which children are vulnerable to child labor, especially agriculture. In addition, the scope of social programs to address child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Lebanon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. A United Nations Children's Fund-funded project trained police officers in Tripoli to identify child labor and refer children to social services. However, children in Lebanon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in the production and trafficking of drugs, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced labor in agriculture. Children also engage in child labor in the production of potatoes and tobacco. Furthermore, government officials continued to indicate that funding is insufficient to properly carry out their duties. In addition, labor inspectors can only conduct inspections in formal places of employment, in which child labor is nearly non-existent, and social programs targeting child labor remained insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Lesotho made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Lesotho’s Multisectoral Committee on Combating Trafficking in Persons launched the National Referral Mechanisms in Trafficking in Persons. The Government of Lesotho also created standard operating procedures for responding to human trafficking violations, with the Home Affairs Ministry distributing the documents in the 10 districts of the country. In addition, the labor inspectorate significantly increased the number of inspections conducted during the reporting period. However, children in Lesotho are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in animal herding. Lesotho’s compulsory education age is below the minimum age for work, leaving children in between these ages vulnerable to child labor. The government also lacks effective coordination mechanisms to address child labor, and labor inspections are not conducted in high-risk sectors, including the informal sector.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Liberia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government ratified the International Labor Organization Convention No. 138: Convention Concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and passed amendments to the 2005 Anti-Human Trafficking Law that remove the requirement of force, fraud, or coercion in child sex trafficking cases. In addition, it removed 38 children from situations of labor exploitation or endangerment and referred them to the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection for social services or placement in shelters. However, children in Liberia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of rubber and the mining of gold and diamonds. Liberia has yet to accede to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict or the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. Moreover, social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Madagascar made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government released studies measuring the prevalence of child labor in mining and street begging and officially launched its action plan to target child labor in the mica sector. Criminal law enforcement officials also secured arrests and convictions for cases involving child pornography and commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition, the government initiated a new program in collaboration with UNICEF to improve, among other targets, education and child protection. Although Madagascar made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, the government failed to investigate reports of some officials accepting bribes to produce and issue false identity documents to facilitate commercial sexual exploitation of minors. Children in Madagascar are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the mica mining sector and in agriculture, including in the production of vanilla. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor, and social programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Malawi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Office of the President assented to legislation amending the Employment Act, establishing provisions that abolish the tenancy system. The tenancy system, which causes tenant farmers and their families to fall into debt bondage, has been a source of forced labor, including for children. In addition, the government launched the National Child Labor Advocacy and Communication Strategy to support the implementation of the National Action Plan on Child Labor and published a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, which included updated statistics on the prevalence of child labor in Malawi. However, children in Malawi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in the harvesting of tobacco and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Minimum age laws do not meet international standards because protections do not extend to children working in private homes and on non-commercial farms. The government did not provide information on its criminal law enforcement efforts related to the worst forms of child labor for inclusion in this report. Moreover, gaps continue to exist in labor law enforcement related to child labor, including insufficient financial resource allocation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Maldives made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted the Second Amendment to the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act and established an Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office to implement the Anti-Human Trafficking National Action Plan 2020–2022. Moreover, after the newly opened permanent shelter for survivors of trafficking was damaged in a storm, the government opened a different temporary shelter. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Maldives are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, illicit activities, and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. The law does not sufficiently prohibit the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Moreover, the government does not have a policy or program to address all relevant worst forms of child labor in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Mali made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The transition government imposed and collected penalties for child labor violations, and published data on its labor law enforcement efforts, including the number of labor inspections conducted. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mali is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continue to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The government provided support to a non-state armed group that recruited and used child soldiers in Mali. Children in Mali are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in the production of cotton and rice, and in artisanal gold mining. Although Mali's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Law criminalizes trafficking for the purpose of slavery, it does not more broadly criminalize the act of slavery. Malian law also does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering of children for illicit activities, and allows children under the age of 18 to be penalized as a direct result of forced recruitment by armed groups. In addition, a new National Plan to Eliminate Child Labor has not been finalized or implemented, and social and rehabilitation services remain inadequate for victims of the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Mauritania made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In January 2022, the Ministry of Labor and Professional Education enacted a decree creating a hazardous work list, identifying 44 forbidden activities. Further, in a major shift in policy, anti-slavery non-governmental organizations were formally registered, allowing them to operate officially and legally. Lastly, Mauritania reported for the first time the number of labor inspections conducted. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mauritania is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a policy and a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Although there were indications of progress, criminal law enforcement authorities did not make adequate efforts to address slavery and its vestiges during the reporting period. In addition, since 2011, the government has required proof of marriage and biological parents’ citizenship for children to obtain a birth certificate. As a result, children born out of wedlock and many Haratine and Sub-Saharan ethnic minority children, including those of slave descent, have been prevented from being registered at birth. Because birth certificates are required for enrollment in secondary school in Mauritania, children as young as age 12 cannot access education, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mauritania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary slavery. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in herding cattle and goats. The government did not make sufficient efforts to enforce some laws related to the worst forms of child labor, including laws on hereditary slavery. In addition, a lack of financial resources and mitigation measures intended to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic severely limited the government's ability to fully implement policies. Furthermore, social programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem. Moreover, the government did not publish comprehensive information about its labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Mauritius made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare enacted the long-awaited Children's Act, which includes more robust provisions related to child prostitution and child pornography violations. The government also enacted the Children's Court Act, which sets out to ensure a child-friendly environment during court proceedings and establishes a Criminal Division with jurisdiction over sexual offences against children. In addition, the government enacted the Child Sex Offender Register Act, which establishes the Child Sex Offender Register that will assist in monitoring, tracking, and investigating sexual offences against children. However, children in Mauritius are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities. Children also engage in child labor in construction and street work. There are many barriers to education access, including conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic that place children at greater risk of child labor. In addition, gaps remain in the implementation of key policies and social programs related to child labor, including the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Mexico made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government carried out 5,000 more labor inspections compared to the previous year and established a new voluntary labor reporting system for businesses to confirm compliance with the Labor Code. The Commission on the Rights of Refugee and Migrant Children and Adolescents also published a report on its activities during the year aiming to ensure the best interests of migrant and refugee children, including unaccompanied minors. Additionally, the government published and implemented the National Program for Children and Adolescents (PRONAPPINA) 2021 - 2024, and the Benito Juárez Wellbeing National Scholarship Program reached 9.8 million students. However, children in Mexico are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of chili peppers, coffee, sugarcane, and tomatoes. In 2021, the government eliminated many social programs that increased educational access and reduced risk for child labor in marginalized communities. Although nearly 60 percent of all employment in Mexico occurs in the informal sector, federal and some state-level labor inspectors carry out inspections in the informal sector only after receiving formal complaints. In addition, labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lacked human and financial resources and the government published limited information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Social programs to combat child labor also do not address all relevant sectors in which child labor is found in Mexico.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Moldova made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In January, Law No. 191 went into effect, which reversed changes that had delegated responsibility for occupational safety and health inspections to 10 smaller agencies and returned it to the State Labor Inspectorate. Legislation was passed to permit a staffing increase at the State Labor Inspectorate from 73 to 104 full-time inspectors. In addition, the Prosecutor General's Office introduced new legislation to establish prescriptive sentences for trafficking in persons and commercial sexual exploitation, including provisions for harsher penalties in cases with aggravated circumstances. However, despite these initiatives, Moldova is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law and practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In August 2018, the government amended Law No. 131 through Law No. 179, such that unannounced inspections, even those based on a complaint or at the request of law enforcement or other state bodies, are permitted only on the basis of a risk assessment that indicates an immediate threat to the environment, life, health, or property. This stringent measure continues to severely limit the State Labor Inspectorate's ability to conduct unannounced inspections. In addition, inspections are only permitted after the State Labor Inspectorate first requests and receives insufficient documentation from the business being inspected or after conducting a risk assessment that finds reasonable indicators of a possible violation. When responding to a complaint, inspectors are not authorized to take action for labor violations they may see that fall outside the scope of the complaint. Children in Moldova are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Training is needed for new criminal investigators, and entities responsible for conducting labor inspections, including of hazardous child labor, lack adequate funding, personnel, and equipment. In addition, there is a lack of social programs to address child trafficking and child labor in agriculture.  </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Mongolia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Through the United States-Mongolia Child Protection Compact Partnership, the government formed a Multi-Disciplinary Taskforce of over 18 governmental and nongovernmental organizations to address human trafficking. It also revised its Labor Law to set the minimum age for work at 15 and the minimum age for light work at 13. In addition, the National Statistical Committee, in cooperation with ILO Mongolia, started collecting information for a national‐level survey on child labor. However, children in Mongolia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in mining and horse jockeying. Mongolia's Revised Labor Law allows for unannounced inspections, but only in the formal work sector, which may impede the enforcement of child labor laws. Mongolia also lacks sustained training opportunities for child protection officers and labor inspectors. In addition, the government did not provide full information on its criminal law enforcement efforts, including information on training for criminal investigations and the number of prosecutions, for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Montenegro made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government took several steps to counter child begging, including by establishing a new Coordination Body for Monitoring and Implementing the Protocol on How Bodies, Institutions, and Organizations in Montenegro Treat Children Living and Working on the Streets, which started revising the text of the Protocol. Additionally, the Parliament approved a new monthly cash allowance for children under age 6 and adopted the new Strategy for the Social Inclusion of Roma and Egyptians (2021–2025). However, children in Montenegro are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, research found that the scope of programs to address child labor in street work is insufficient.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Montserrat, in 2021, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government issued one-time cash payments to families with children as part of its COVID-19 relief efforts. However, Montserrat is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a law that delays advancement to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Labor inspectors do not have the authority to conduct unannounced inspections, as they must obtain either the business owner's consent or a search warrant in order to enter a business for the purposes of performing an inspection. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Additionally, the government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the law does not prohibit the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups or the use of children in illicit activities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased the number of labor inspectors by over 43 percent and launched a new labor inspectorate information technology management system that enabled remote training sessions for inspectors in compliance with COVID-19 pandemic countermeasures. In addition, the government signed eight partnership agreements with local non-government organizations in various regions of Morocco to counter the prevalence of child labor. However, children in Morocco are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work. Moroccan law on the minimum age for work does not meet international standards. Furthermore, the scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Mozambique made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched an initiative to reduce the risks of human trafficking and child labor due to emergencies, such as armed conflict and natural disasters. In addition, in order to reduce the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government augmented a support program, with subsidies of $25 (1,500 meticais), as well as food distribution for vulnerable families. The government also launched an Education Strategic Plan with the aim of ensuring the continuity of safe, quality education nationwide during and after emergency situations. However, children in Mozambique are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in the production of tobacco. In addition, the established minimum age for work is not in compliance with international labor standards because it does not extend to informal employment. Lastly, existing social programs are insufficient to fully address the extent of the child labor problem in Mozambique.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Namibia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government substantially drafted an updated National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons to guide responses to human trafficking, including of children, and substantially increased funding for shelters servicing the physical and psychosocial needs of trafficking survivors. In addition, the government coordinated a training with the International Organization for Migration for front line officers and humanitarian actors to identify and respond to human trafficking in response to growing climate migration. Children in Namibia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in domestic work and street work. Prevention and elimination of child labor are not integrated into key national policies. In addition, social programs do not address child labor in agriculture and domestic work. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Nepal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published data from the 2018 Nepal Labor Force Survey, which estimated that 1.1 million children are engaged in child labor. Additionally, the Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens approved the Online Child Protection Procedure, 2021, to help curb online abuse of children. The Nepal Child Rights Council also formed new Child Protection Committees in 129 local governments. In addition, the government repatriated 60 victims of human trafficking and expanded access to education through The New School Education Plan. However, children in Nepal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in producing bricks. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet international standards for legal prohibitions against child trafficking and legal prohibitions against the use of children for illicit activities. The law related to child trafficking is insufficient because it does not clearly criminalize recruitment, harboring, receipt, or transportation in the absence of force, fraud, or coercion, and the law prohibiting the use of children in illicit activities is insufficient because it does not prohibit the use of children in the production of drugs. The Department of Labor’s budget, the number of labor inspectors, and available resources and training are also insufficient for enforcing labor laws, including those related to child labor. Furthermore, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Nicaragua made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government participated in an IOM social media anti-trafficking in persons awareness campaign called Recognize the Signs (Atendé las Señales) and conducted 1,409 nationwide door-to-door visits to families of children ages six and under to promote school attendance. However, children in Nicaragua are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Laws do not establish a clear compulsory education age, and the government lacks adequate services for human trafficking victims, such as shelters. Additionally, labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandates. The government also lacks a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Niger made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created the National Steering Committee to Combat Child Labor. In addition, Niger signed a memorandum of understanding with Nigeria, formalizing cooperation agreements between the two governments to improve their collective response to human trafficking. Further, the government developed a National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons and a Plan for Social and Economic Development. However, children in Niger are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and mining, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks herding livestock.  The minimum age for work does not meet international standards because it does not apply to children in unpaid or non-contractual work. In addition, the government made no efforts to address the ongoing practice of wahaya, a form of child slavery that was upheld as illegal by a Nigerien court in 2019. Lastly, gaps in labor law enforcement also remain, including insufficient funding for labor inspectors to conduct inspections.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Nigeria made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government validated the National Policy on Child Labor and the National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor (2021–2025). The Ministry of Labor and Employment also created a new program to provide vulnerable households with seed capital to fund new businesses in areas with high rates of child labor. However, children in Nigeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and use in armed conflict as well as quarrying granite and artisanal mining. The Child's Right Act has been adopted by only 29 out of Nigeria's 36 states (including the capital federal territory), leaving the remaining 7 states in northern Nigeria with legal statutes that do not meet international standards for the prohibition of child trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, and illicit activities. In addition, the minimum age for work in the Labor Act does not apply to children who are self-employed or working in the informal economy.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Niue, in 2021, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Niue has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists on Norfolk Island, in 2021, the government made moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Australian Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth) was amended to include provisions for workers and workplaces on Norfolk Island. However, Norfolk Island's laws do not set a minimum age for light work, which is not in compliance with international standards. In addition, the law does not specify activities in which light work may be permitted.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, North Macedonia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Labor Inspectorate received an increased budget to improve hiring capacity, and there was a marked increase in the number of worksite inspections over the course of the year. In addition, the government adopted the National Action Plan Against Trafficking in Persons and Illegal Migration (2021–2025) and an accompanying operational plan for the 2021–2022 period, both addressing the unique needs of children and other populations considered to be most at risk for trafficking in persons. The government also adopted the Employment and Social Policy Reform Program with the goal of creating new initiatives focused on poverty reduction and social inclusion for the country's most vulnerable populations. However, children in North Macedonia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. The law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships. Additionally, the government has not adopted a policy to address all worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Oman made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new National Plan for Combating Human Trafficking, established child protection committees at the governorate level, and investigated and charged two suspects in a child sex trafficking case. The labor inspectorate also increased inspections in response to videos shared on social media documenting labor violations. Although research is limited, there is evidence that small numbers of children in Oman engage in child labor, including in fishing and farming. Government policies do not address all forms of child labor and the Ministry of Labor is not represented on the National Committee on Implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child or the National Child Protection Committee.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Pakistan made minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delays advancement to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Pakistani federal government and some provincial governments enacted legislation to address the worst forms of child labor, including bills prohibiting hazardous work for children under 14 years in Balochistan; banning corporal punishment of children, including in domestic work; and establishing special courts dedicated to child protection. Additionally, the Federal Investigative Authority provided training for Pakistani police, social welfare and labor departments, and child protection bureaus at the central and provincial level. The Child Protection and Welfare Bureau rescued over 1,000 children from begging in Punjab and referred 1,500 to 2,000 children for psychological counselling. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Pakistan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Pakistan continued to support the Taliban in Afghanistan and the militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in the Jammu and Kashmir region, and reports indicate that both groups recruited and used child soldiers during the reporting period. Children in Pakistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work. Children also engage in forced labor in brick manufacturing and agriculture. Additionally, provincial labor inspectorates do not have sufficient resources to adequately enforce laws prohibiting child labor, and the federal and provincial governments did not publicly release information on their labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Furthermore, police corruption, particularly the taking of bribes from suspected perpetrators to ignore child labor crimes and a lack of willingness to conduct criminal investigations, hindered Pakistan's ability to address child labor throughout the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Panama made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a new digital platform for reporting child abuse complaints, including cases of children subjected to commercial sexual exploitation, begging, and forced labor. The Ministry of Labor also signed an agreement with the National Council of Private Enterprises that promotes a public-private partnership for the creation of a network of companies that work on the prevention and eradication of child labor. In addition, the government increased the number of labor inspectors from 93 in 2020 to 105 in 2021, as well as provided social services to 800 child survivors and children at risk of child labor. However, children in Panama are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Panamanian law allows minors under age 16 to engage in hazardous work within training facilities in violation of international standards. Moreover, labor law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandate. Finally, existing social programs are insufficient to address the full scope of the child labor problem in the country, in particular for children living in rural areas and from indigenous and Afro-Panamanian communities. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Papua New Guinea made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government continued with rescue and enforcement efforts and joined UNICEF's Pathfinding program, which is a global partnership to end violence against children. However, children in Papua New Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining and deep-sea fishing. Papua New Guinea's hazardous work prohibitions do not comply with international standards that require all children under age 18 to be protected from work that could jeopardize their health and safety, nor do its laws prohibit using, procuring, or offering a child for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Schools continued charging fees as a result of not receiving promised government subsidies needed for education to remain free and accessible for all children. In addition, insufficient resources hampered the labor inspectorate’s capacity to enforce child labor laws. Papua New Guinea has not conducted a nationwide survey of child labor and does not collect data on its efforts to enforce it labor laws. The Government of Papua New Guinea did not respond to requests for information on its law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Paraguay made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor finalized a resolution that established new procedures for more prompt investigations of child labor and expanded its use of virtual outreach and training, and the Departmental Committees for the Eradication of Child Labor opened new offices in three departments across the country. The government also expanded the Support for the Community Kitchens Program, which focuses on relieving economic strain on families at risk of child labor. However, children in Paraguay are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic servitude and in debt bondage in cattle raising, on dairy farms, and in charcoal factories. Children with disabilities as well as those from rural and indigenous communities face difficulties accessing and completing their education. In addition, limited funding for law enforcement agencies and social programs hampered the government’s ability to fully address the worst forms of child labor, particularly in rural areas. Paraguay's criminal law enforcement agencies also lack resources to sufficiently identify, investigate, and prosecute cases of the worst forms of child labor, especially in remote areas.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Peru made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created a National Forced Labor Observatory to collect and consolidate information on this abuse and government efforts to address it. It also approved national implementation of the Municipal Model for the Detection and Eradication of Child Labor and the Ministry of Labor and Promotion of Employment convened 26 regional commissions for the prevention and eradication of child labor. In addition, the government published an updated National Plan of Action Against Trafficking in Persons for the 2022–2030 period. However, children in Peru are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Peruvian law allows children ages 12 to 14 to do light work without specifying the activities in which children may work. Labor law enforcement agencies in Peru also lack sufficient inspectors and training to adequately address child labor, and the government did not provide complete information on criminal enforcement efforts against child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, the Philippines made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched an online hotline for reporting cases of online sexual exploitation of children and opened its first Cyber-Trafficking in Persons Monitoring Center in response to the substantial increase of online commercial sexual exploitation since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government also launched the Child Protect Mobile app, which raises awareness about violence against children, including child labor, and provides information on public and private organizations that provide intervention services. In addition, the government committed $800,000 to implement its anti-trafficking program and increased funding for its Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking by $200,000 which was applied towards surveillance, rescue operations, and victim assistance efforts. Although the government made meaningful efforts during the reporting period, it did not adequately protect children allegedly engaged in drug trafficking from inappropriate incarceration or physical harm during detention. Children in the Philippines are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and gold mining. Moreover, the enforcement of child labor laws remained challenging throughout the country, especially due to the low number of labor inspectors and the lack of a mechanism to assess civil penalties for child labor violations. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Rwanda made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Rwanda finalized a new national action plan to combat human trafficking and launched a new hotline for the public to report child abuse, including child labor. Furthermore, the Isange One Stop Centers that provide services to human trafficking victims inaugurated the first child-safe space to provide care to child victims of trafficking. However, children in Rwanda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining, including carrying heavy loads. Reports indicate that government officials have detained children subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and forced street begging in transit centers intended for individuals demonstrating so-called deviant behaviors, in which children often experience physical abuse. The number of labor inspectors does not meet the International Labor Organization's technical advice for the size of Rwanda's workforce. Finally, social programs do not address all relevant sectors in which child labor is present.    </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha, in 2021, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Ascensión passed a new Employment Ordinance during the reporting period which sets the minimum age for work at 14. However, Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in preventing the worst forms of child labor. There is no functioning labor inspectorate in Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha to enforce labor laws. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the islands have yet to define, by law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, other than work on vessels engaged in maritime navigation. Gaps also remain in legislation across Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha related to forced child labor and the trafficking of children for labor exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Saint Lucia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the Counter-Trafficking Amendment Act, which includes provisions to protect victims of human trafficking regardless of their citizenship status. The government also increased its number of labor inspectors from 4 in 2020 to 8 in 2021 and updated standard operating procedures for the identification, referral, and protection of victims of human trafficking. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Lucia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in the sale and distribution of drugs. Saint Lucia's legal framework does not sufficiently prohibit the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the use of children in illicit activities. In addition, policies addressing all forms of child labor, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, do not exist.</Description>

The National Task Force Against Trafficking in Persons coordinated numerous trainings for the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Unit of the Royal Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force, frontline healthcare workers, and frontline volunteers from the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Red Cross Society. The training modules addressed human trafficking indicators, such as victim identification, care and protection, awareness raising, and survivor and professional resources. In addition, the government distributed food parcels to 349 student participants through its program Zero Hunger Trust Fund. The government also funded and provided resources for several human trafficking awareness campaigns, including a live radio program, distributing hundreds of brochures to evacuees of the La Soufrière volcano eruption, and training to healthcare and frontline workers. However, children in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines engage in child labor in street vending, including selling fruits and vegetables at local farmers' markets. Gaps remain in the legal framework, as the law does not fully meet international standards because the use of children for prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances is not prohibited. In addition, the minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards and there is no legislation prohibiting the using, procuring, and offering of children in illicit activities, including in the production of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Samoa made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published the results of the Samoa Demographic Health Survey and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019–2020, with data on child labor. In addition, Samoa's Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Labor, the Samoa Child Labor Task Force, and the International Labor Organization hosted the Child Labor Forum, in which the Government of Samoa committed to becoming an Alliance 8.7 Pathfinder Country. However, children in Samoa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in street work. Furthermore, research found no evidence of laws that prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the government did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Senegal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government commenced activities for the 2021–2023 National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings and launched a program to support children living and working on the streets. It also held trainings for labor inspectors focused on data collection on child labor in the informal economy. However, children in Senegal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include domestic work or street work, areas in which there is evidence of potential harm to child workers, and labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lack resources to adequately enforce child labor law. In addition, Senegal does not have a current national action plan or a national coordinating body for the elimination of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Serbia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a number of guidelines to facilitate improved coordination between social services providers and labor authorities. The Labor Inspectorate also received an increased budget, which allowed inspectors to conduct more inspections than in previous years. However, children in Serbia are still subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Serbia's laws do not treat forced child beggars as victims of child labor, and the country's social welfare centers are overburdened, which limits efforts to provide services to victims of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Sierra Leone made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified the Protocol of the Forced Labor Convention, the Domestic Workers Convention, and Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, as well as the Economic Community of West African States Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, providing the government with additional tools to apprehend and prosecute human traffickers. Sierra Leone also launched the National Policy on Radical Inclusion in Schools with the aim of ensuring education access to all children in the country. However, children in Sierra Leone are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in mining. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in quarrying stone and fishing. The types of hazardous work prohibited for children do not cover all sectors in which child labor is known to occur, and the government does not have a sufficient number of labor inspectors to adequately enforce labor laws throughout the country. In addition, Sierra Leone lacks a national policy and social program to address all relevant worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, the Solomon Islands made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed a National Education Action Plan for 2021–2025 and held consultations on the process to accede to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons. However, children in the Solomon Islands are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of palm oil fruits. The minimum age for work does not meet international standards, and the Solomon Islands has not established a minimum age for hazardous work or delineated the types of work considered hazardous for children. In addition, there is no law that makes education compulsory, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor exploitation. The government also did not publish labor and criminal law enforcement data for the reporting year.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Somalia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Member States participated in a workshop to validate findings from an International Labor Organization-conducted assessment of child labor in Somalia, which will inform future programing and policies in Somalia, including the National Action Plan to address child labor. The Ministry of Defense's Child Protection Unit also organized a number of training and awareness-raising forums to support implementation of the United Nations-supported 2012 action plans and the 2019 roadmap to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Somalia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. During the reporting period, there is evidence that federal and state security forces continued to recruit and use children in armed conflict, in violation of national law. In other cases, government security forces detained children for suspected association with armed groups, in some cases subjecting them to lengthy interrogations and coerced confessions. Children in Somalia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The government did not conduct worksite inspections in 2021. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Somali laws do not criminally prohibit child labor trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, or the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups. The government did not provide complete information on its criminal law enforcement efforts to address child labor for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, South Africa made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. South Africa added an additional 484 labor inspectors, bringing its labor inspectorate staffing into alignment with International Labor Organization technical advice. In addition, Statistics South Africa published the results of its Survey of Activities of Young People, a household-level survey on children's economic activities, including child labor. Finally, South Africa began criminal prosecution of seven Chinese nationals who stand accused of forced child labor, human trafficking, and other related crimes. However, children in South Africa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, forced begging, and use in illicit activities. Social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor, and free basic education is not guaranteed by law.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, South Sudan is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, South Sudan is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. Military forces continued to recruit children, sometimes forcibly, to fight opposition groups. Otherwise, the government made efforts by supporting the Justice for Children initiative, which refers victims of child labor to special courts that have judges who are trained on how to adjudicate cases involving minors. The South Sudan People's Defense Force also launched a mobile general martial court in Jonglei and Upper Nile to commence trials for 60 suspected perpetrators of crimes against civilians, including children. Furthermore, the Ministry of General Education and Instructions, in collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund and the United States Agency for International Development, distributed 15,498 solar powered radio sets to 70,718 vulnerable school children that facilitated lesson access during the first quarter of the year while schools remained closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Children in South Sudan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in armed conflict, and forced labor in cattle herding. The government did not hold perpetrators of child labor accountable and has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons. In addition, police continued to arrest and imprison children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation rather than treating them as victims.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Sri Lanka made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the hazardous occupations list by expanding it to include domestic labor, and amended the Minimum Wages Ordinance, the Shop and Office Employees' Act, and the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act to raise the minimum age of employment from 14 to 16 years. The government also prioritized the fisheries and plantation sectors for awareness activities, conducting various trainings and other awareness-raising programs regarding eliminating child labor. In addition, it prepared a National Strategic Action Plan to Monitor and Combat Human Trafficking (2021–2025) and released a Standard Operating Procedure on the Identification, Protection, and Referral of Child Victims of Trafficking in English, Sinhala, and Tamil in partnership with an NGO. However, children in Sri Lanka are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it did not impose criminal penalties for violations related to the worst forms of child labor or publish data on its efforts to address child labor crimes. Research indicates some children in rural areas face barriers to accessing education, including difficulties in traveling to school in some regions and an inadequate number of teachers. Furthermore, the labor inspectorate lacked sufficient staffing or funding to carry out inspections, especially inspections of factories in the northern and eastern provinces.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Suriname made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted an annual plan to implement its National Action Plan to Combat Child Labor, which includes 21 action points, including the appointment of a Special Child Labor Rapporteur and capacity strengthening for the labor inspectorate. The Trafficking in Persons Working Group also drafted a victim-centered strategic plan and operations manual, which includes consideration for child survivors of human trafficking. Moreover, the government conducted an evaluation of Suriname's implementation of the United Nation's International Convention on the Rights of Children. However, children in Suriname are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining.  The compulsory education age does not reach the minimum age for employment, leaving some children vulnerable to labor exploitation. Suriname also lacked targeted inspections in risk-prone sectors. In addition, the Penal Code does not meet international standards as it does not include "practices similar to slavery," including debt bondage, serfdom, and forced labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, São Tomé and Príncipe made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government provided training for all labor inspectors on issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on the 2019 Labor Code. Additional training was also provided by the International Labor Organization, including the module "Labor Inspection in Fighting Against Child Labor." Moreover, in July 2021, funding for the Family Program increased from $10 million to $18 million, raising the number of program participants from 3,500 to 16,000. The distribution of these funds will continue for a period of 9 months, providing stipends twice a month for the poorest families. However, children in São Tomé and Príncipe are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Labor Code permits children younger than age 14 to work under certain circumstances, which is not consistent with international standards. Moreover, limited financial resources hampered law enforcement efforts, and criminal law enforcement did not take actions to address child labor during the reporting period. In addition, policies addressing the worst forms of child labor do not exist.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, The United Republic of Tanzania made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government issued a circular directing that girls be able to return to school following the completion of their pregnancy, reversing its previous support of permanently expelling girls who had become pregnant. The government also committed additional resources to address other barriers to educational access, including provision of additional classrooms and latrines, as well as desks. In addition, the government facilitated awareness campaigns related to human trafficking and trained 17 local committees focusing on child labor and other issues related to violence against women and children. However, children in Tanzania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in mining, quarrying, and domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Mainland government did not publicly release information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Other gaps remain in the legal framework and enforcement of laws related to child labor, including protections for the use of children in illicit activities and domestic work and the likely insufficient number of labor inspectors for the size of Tanzania’s labor force. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Thailand made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Government of Thailand approved the third National Policy and Plan to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor Phase III (2021–2022), which included the Ministry of Labor signing a memorandum of understanding with 13 business associations to prevent child and forced labor in the shrimp, fishing, sugarcane, and garment industries. The government also published statistics on the number of investigations conducted, violations found, and convictions secured for crimes related to the worst forms of child labor. Moreover, the Ministry of Education implemented a program in cooperation with the Ministry of Labor, the Office of the Ombudsman, and other related government agencies to provide education on labor rights, assist with vocational training, and share job vacancies to 1,127 student trainees. However, children in Thailand are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children, some as young as age 12, also participate for remuneration in Muay Thai competitions, an area of hazardous work in which there is evidence of serious head injuries. Thailand does not meet the international standard for the minimum age for work because the law does not grant protections to children working outside of formal employment relationships. Lastly, child labor law enforcement remains a challenge due to an insufficient number of inspectors and resources to physically inspect remote workplaces.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Timor-Leste made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established the Commission to Combat Trafficking in Persons and convicted two perpetrators of child sex trafficking, its second and third convictions under the 2017 Law on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Persons. However, despite recent efforts to address child labor, Timor-Leste is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. While no law or policy prohibits pregnant girls from attending school, reports continued of orders from school principals that forced girls to leave school when they became pregnant, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Timor-Leste are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in street vending and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. In addition, while Timor-Leste law provides for criminal penalties for the worst forms of child labor, there is a lack of authorization for labor inspection agencies to inspect or enforce labor standards in the informal agriculture and commercial sectors. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Togo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created a new National Commission Against Trafficking in Persons and passed a new Labor Code that strengthened enforcement mechanisms. In addition, the government waived school fees for the 2021–2022 school year for all secondary school students due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, children in Togo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. The government has not devoted sufficient resources to address child labor, and in 2021, the budget for the labor inspectorate declined by nearly 40 percent. In addition, the government does not publish data related to its criminal enforcement efforts with regard to laws on the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Tokelau, in 2021, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor, as the law does not criminally prohibit forced labor and child trafficking. In addition, Tokelau has not established a minimum age for work and does not prohibit hazardous occupations for children.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Tonga made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Tonga and the Government of New Zealand launched a new joint education project outlining a 15-year policy framework for Tonga's education system. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tonga is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that there are no labor inspectors and there is no legal authority to conduct labor inspections. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Tonga are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in farming and fishing. Gaps in the legal framework also remain; the country has no laws specifying a minimum age for work or defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation. In addition, the government did not provide information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Tunisia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In July 2021, the Tunisian parliament passed the Domestic Workers Bill, prohibiting the employment of children in domestic work. In April 2021, the Second Chance program, which reintegrates school dropouts ages 12 to 18 back into the educational system or provides them with vocational training, opened a new location. Additionally, in November 2021, a new emergency shelter for children in Tunis was created, along with five other shelters across the country dedicated to the needs of children. However, children in Tunisia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in scavenging through garbage and in street work. Government officials have noted that the budget for staffing and logistics, such as fuel and transportation, is inadequate to carry out inspections, especially in remote areas of the country. Additionally, the government was unable to provide complete data on its enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report, due to records management challenges and delays in the digitization of court records.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Tuvalu made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Tuvalu published the results from the Tuvalu Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019-2020, which provides the country's most recent and comprehensive data on child labor. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Tuvalu engage in child labor in fishing and domestic work. The government has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Tuvalu lacks information on labor law and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Uganda made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its efforts to investigate, prosecute, and sentence government officials complicit in facilitating the worst forms of child labor. Uganda also reconstituted its National Steering Committee on the Elimination of Child Labor. In addition, the government approved a new national action plan to address child labor. However, children in Uganda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. The lack of a centralized supervisory authority along with inadequate funding, training, and resources, hampered the capacity of law enforcement agencies to conduct child labor inspections and investigations. In addition, the law only guarantees free education through the primary level, which does not meet the international standard that free basic education through lower secondary school be guaranteed by law. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Ukraine made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted Law No. 1256-IX, which strengthened Ukraine's child protection framework by criminalizing the sexual exploitation of children in accordance with the Council of Europe's Lanzarote Convention. The Office of the Prosecutor General issued Order No. 224 to ensure all Ukrainian government bodies responsible for investigating crimes against children are fully observing the laws and regulations aimed at protecting minors. Additionally, the Ministry of Social Policy collaborated with UNICEF to develop a National Strategy for Children's Rights. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Ukraine is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to uphold Act No. 877-V of 2007, which both restricts labor inspectors' ability to conduct regular workplace visits and places limits on the time, scope, and duration of worksite inspections. Furthermore, in 2021, the National Police opened criminal investigations against 72 children for participation in Russia-led military formations in the so-called "Donetsk People’s Republic" and "Luhansk People’s Republic," as well as one child in the Russia-led forces in Crimea; it transferred 47 of these cases to courts for prosecution. Children in Ukraine are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of pornography. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. The government collected few of the financial penalties imposed for child labor violations and lacked social programs designed to assist children engaged in hazardous work in mining. In addition, it remains unclear how Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 will affect the child labor situation throughout the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Uzbekistan made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed legislation which amended their law on commercial sexual exploitation of children to bring it into full compliance with international standards. The government amended the Code of Administrative Liability and the Criminal Code to increase punishments for forced labor and child labor, including its worst forms, and to create criminal liability for individuals who commit child labor violations. The government also undertook a survey to assess allegations of child labor in the silk industry and signed a new Decent Work Country Program for 2021–2025. Additionally, the government continued to raise awareness and enforce prohibitions against the use of child labor and forced labor in the cotton harvest. Research indicates that the use of forced labor in the cotton harvest has been eliminated outside of isolated incidents, largely as a result of government efforts to implement and enforce forced labor prohibitions. However, children in Uzbekistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and public works. While the Government of Uzbekistan has made strong progress in addressing labor issues in the cotton harvest, there continue to be impediments to the operation of NGOs in addressing broader labor concerns. Human rights NGOs and civil society organizations, including those working on forced and child labor issues, are frequently denied official registration for bureaucratic reasons, sometimes for failing to meet registration requirements that had not been publicly specified.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Vanuatu made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created the National Steering Committee on Migrant Protection, which serves to enhance the ability of the government to identify and respond to cases of trafficking in persons, including child labor trafficking, and the Ministry of Education and Training released the Vanuatu Education and Training Sector Strategic Plan (2021–2030), which outlines policies and strategies to improve access to education for all children in the country. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Vanuatu are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in forestry and logging activities. Vanuatu’s minimum age for hazardous work is below that of international standards. Vanuatu also lacks a referral mechanism between criminal authorities and social services providers. Significant commitment to eradicate child labor is still required, especially with funding and interagency coordination procedures. In addition, the Government of Vanuatu did not respond to requests for information for this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, the Palestinian Authority made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the areas of the West Bank under its control. The Ministry of Labor detected 51 cases of child labor and imposed 19 penalties. However, children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in illicit activities. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction and fishing. The Palestinian Authority’s legal framework does not criminally prohibit all elements of child trafficking. In addition, Palestinian Authority programs to prevent or eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kingdom of Morocco claims the territory of Western Sahara and administers the area that it controls with the same constitution, laws, and structures as in internationally recognized Morocco, including laws that deal with child labor. During the reporting period, the government increased the number of labor inspectors by over 43 percent and launched a new labor inspectorate information technology management system that enabled remote training sessions for inspectors in compliance with COVID-19 pandemic countermeasures. In addition, the government signed eight partnership agreements with local non-governmental organizations in various regions of Morocco to counter the prevalence of child labor. However, children in Western Sahara are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. The law on minimum age for work does not meet international standards. Furthermore, the scope of government social programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Yemen made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The International Labor Organization provided training to Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor employees. However, despite this initiative, Yemen is assessed as having made minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. There is evidence of recruitment and use of children in hostilities by state armed forces in contravention of Yemeni law. Furthermore, the government failed to make efforts to address discrimination in schools against children from the Muhamasheen (“marginalized”) community, leading to their increased vulnerability to child labor. Children in Yemen are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and armed conflict, including by Houthi insurgent forces (also known as Ansar Allah) and other armed groups. Children also perform dangerous tasks in fishing. Research found no evidence of a government policy on worst forms of child labor outside of child soldiering, such as commercial sexual exploitation or child trafficking. Moreover, the Republic of Yemen Government continued to have limited operational control over its ministries and was unable to enforce regulations to address child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2021, Zambia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the number of labor inspectors to 240, from 160 the previous year. The government also launched its second National Action Plan for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, allocated funding to hire 22,000 schoolteachers, and collected updated data on the number of children in child labor and in hazardous work. However, children in Zambia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in agriculture. The Education Act does not specify a compulsory education age, and human trafficking laws do not meet international standards because they require threats, the use of force, or coercion to establish the crime of child trafficking. In addition, labor inspectors do not routinely inspect non-registered businesses in which child labor is known to occur.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2021, Zimbabwe made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Assembly began consideration of amendments to the Labor Act, which would increase penalties for child labor violations. The government, with the United Nations, also launched an updated Sustainable Development Cooperation Assistance Framework, prioritizing increased educational access and social protections for girls and other groups vulnerable to child labor. However, Zimbabwe is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it implemented a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Evidenced by a pattern of threats and intimidation of worker organizations and trade unionists, high-level officials within the Government of Zimbabwe and the ruling political party interfered with a delegation representing worker and civil society organizations to investigate concerns of child labor occurring at a commercial farm, sending party activists to the farm to threaten and intimidate the delegation. Children in Zimbabwe are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in mines and on farms. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the harvesting of sugarcane and tobacco. The government did not publicly release information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report, and law enforcement agencies lack resources to enforce child labor laws. In addition, gaps remain in the country’s legal framework against child labor, including the prohibition of commercial sexual exploitation of children.</Description>
