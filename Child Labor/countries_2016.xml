    <Description>In 2022, Afghanistan made no advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 resulted in an increase in the prevalence of child labor, including its worst forms, and exacerbated existing child labor risks for girls. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, drought conditions, and worsening economic conditions further exacerbated child labor, child marriage, and child trafficking in the country. During the reporting period, the Taliban actively recruited and used children as part of their security forces. Furthermore, authorities considered some child trafficking victims, especially those engaged in bacha bazi or in armed conflict, as criminals, housing them in juvenile detention centers and subjecting them to torture and other forms of ill treatment rather than referring them to victim support services. Children in Afghanistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict, forced labor in the production of bricks and carpets, and commercial sexual exploitation. The government lacks a mechanism to impose penalties for child labor violations and sufficient programs to address situations of child labor or prevent its occurrence. In addition, Afghan law does not sufficiently criminalize forced labor, debt bondage, or the commercial sexual exploitation of girls.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Albania made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government continued to support the work of the Special Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime Court, which was established in 2019 and has the power to hear cases involving human trafficking if linked to organized crime (including cases involving children). Additionally, during the reporting period the government supported policies focused on improving children's rights, including the National Agenda for the Rights of the Child and the National Strategy on Education. However, children in Albania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in illicit activities and forced begging, and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in scavenging, including scavenging for chromium near mines. Albania's legal framework governing child labor also does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Algeria made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted legislation to remove the requirement of proving force, fraud, or coercion in some circumstances for an act to be considered child trafficking; the law was approved by both chambers of parliament in April 2023 and will enter into force after its publication in the official gazette. The National Authority for the Protection and Promotion of Children also launched an online platform to increase coordination among civil society organizations working on child protection issues. However, children in Algeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also engage in street vending. Algerian law does not provide increased penalties for, or categorize as a separate crime, the involvement of children in either the production or trafficking of drugs. The government also has not determined by national law or regulation the types of work that are hazardous for children to perform. Moreover, while the labor inspectorate is authorized to conduct inspections in all workplaces, inspectors do not investigate some workplaces, such as houses or informal construction sites, without a complaint, resulting in instances of child labor going undetected. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Angola made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government updated the list of hazardous occupations and activities for children, including 52 activities, 39 of which were not found on the previous list. The Ministry of Public Administration, Labor, and Social Security conducted training workshops focused on capacity building for child protection stakeholders, and several trainings and workshops on human trafficking concepts were provided by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights to members of the Angolan diplomatic corps, national police, prosecutors, and all 18 provincial human rights committees. Additionally, the Multisectoral Commission on the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor established procedures to process and report child labor cases and strengthened its coordination with law enforcement and social services providers. However, children in Angola are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. Laws prohibiting forced labor are not sufficient as they do not criminalize practices similar to slavery or allow for the prosecution of debt bondage. Additionally, the number of labor inspectors is likely insufficient for the size of Angola's workforce, and social programs do not target all sectors in which  children work.   </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Anguilla, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum age of 12 for work and 14 for hazardous work does not meet international standards, and Anguilla lacks a list of prohibited hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Argentina made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government reported completing an additional 25 actions from the "100 Actions Against Trafficking" list outlined in its National Action Plan Against Human Trafficking. It also published the National Plan for the Regularization of Labor, which includes an allocation of funding for the labor inspectorate, and greatly increased the number of worksite inspections compared to pandemic years. Furthermore, the government published operating rules under the Mica Ortega Law that created an Observatory, an Interministerial Administrative Coordination Unit, and a Committee of Advisors to address sexual grooming and cybersafety of children. However, children in Argentina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the transport, sale, and distribution of drugs. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government does not publish complete information about its labor law enforcement efforts and the labor inspectorate remains understaffed to adequately address child labor issues in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Armenia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted a new Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, which strengthened Armenia’s child protection framework by criminalizing child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The government also adopted a universal inspection checklist on labor rights violations which is applicable to all industries. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Armenia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law that delays advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Labor inspectors lack full authority to conduct unannounced inspections, despite receiving additional authority in 2022 to carry out limited unannounced inspections when detecting unregistered employment cases. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Children in Armenia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. In addition, the government does not routinely collect or maintain official data on the prevalence of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Azerbaijan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Internal Affairs trained more than 700 police officers from 25 city and district police units on forced labor and human trafficking issues. In addition, the government continued efforts to integrate children with disabilities into mainstream education by establishing 12 more schools with inclusive classrooms, in addition to the existing 8 schools. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it has not rescinded a law that delays advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. This law continues a moratorium on all worksite labor inspections. While inspectors can conduct desk reviews in response to complaints, this lack of proactive or onsite inspection mechanisms may leave potential violations of child labor laws undetected in workplaces. Children in Azerbaijan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. In addition, data are limited regarding how many children are currently engaged in child labor. In some instances, police treat children forced to beg or engage in street work as a family issue, leading to child labor cases not being properly referred for criminal investigation and prosecution.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practices that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Bangladesh made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Department of Inspections for Factories and Establishments rescued 3,990 children from working in various hazardous sectors. Furthermore, the government added five additional sectors to the hazardous work list (dried fish production; informal steel-based work; brick and stone production, collection, and carrying; tailoring and informal production of garments; and waste management), officially prohibiting children from working in these jobs. The Bangladesh government also launched its first national study on human trafficking. The study will help provide a baseline understanding of the human trafficking situation in the country, including how human trafficking crimes are committed and how victims are targeted. However, despite these initiatives to address child labor, Bangladesh is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continues to obstruct educational opportunities for Rohingya children. The government has closed Rohingya-operated schools, banned Rohingya children from attending private schools outside of refugee camps, and threatened Rohingya children and teachers with having their identity cards confiscated, all of which further hampered educational access for Rohingya refugee children. Furthermore, children in Bangladesh are still subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in the drying of fish and the production of bricks. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of garments and leather goods. The Bangladesh Labor Act does not apply to children working in all sectors in which child labor occurs. Though the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts related to child labor in 2022, penalties for child labor violations can only be imposed after a lengthy legal process and, when courts do impose them, the fines are too low to deter child labor law violations.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Belize made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the National Child Labor Policy and Strategy 2022-2025, which aims to eliminate the worst forms of child labor by 2025 and prioritizes addressing legislative and information gaps, increasing child labor law compliance, and reducing barriers to education. The Ministry of Human Development also introduced new standard operating procedures on human trafficking and trained 85 percent of social workers, 80 percent of labor officers, and 78 percent of immigration officers on using the procedures to refer victims to care. However, children in Belize are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture and construction. Belize does not meet the international standard for prohibitions of hazardous work because children over age 14 are permitted to work in dangerous activities like mining and construction. In addition, Belize has not adequately prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Benin made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Benin provided criminal law enforcement data on investigations and prosecutions concerning the worst forms of child labor for publication in this report. The government also renewed and contributed funding to the Integrated National School Feeding Program, which provides meals at 75 percent of Benin's schools. Finally, labor inspectors, social workers, and judicial police officers received training from the Directorate General of Labor on standard operating procedures for child labor cases. However, children in Benin are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in the production of cotton and crushed granite. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work and street vending. There are many barriers to education, especially for children with disabilities. In addition, inadequate funding for the labor inspectorate may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Bhutan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Royal Government of Bhutan ratified the Palermo Protocol and the United Nations Protocol Against Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, and Air. Additionally, it conducted anti-trafficking training programs for 72 judges and carried out 7 awareness programs on countering human trafficking for over 2,600 students. However, children in Bhutan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Bhutan’s minimum age for work of 13 does not meet international standards and education is not compulsory. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to address child labor, including its worst forms, and the government did not publicly release information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Bolivia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its number of labor inspectors from 72 to 123 and launched a new national action plan to address human trafficking. The municipal government of Santa Cruz also trained 300 university students to volunteer in the Market Spaces program, which is designed to offer services and support to children who work in the markets with their families. However, children in Bolivia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the harvesting of Brazil nuts, and mining. Although Bolivian law requires that apprentices attend school, it does not set a minimum age for participation in apprenticeships. In addition, prohibitions against child trafficking are insufficient because they require that the use of threats, force, or coercion be proven for a trafficking crime to have occurred. The government also did not publicly release information in 2022 on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Council of Ministers approved the 2021-2025 National Action Plan for the Social Inclusion of Roma, which aims to strength education access for Roma children, and the Anti-Trafficking Strike Force expanded its membership to include representatives from additional agencies. The Tuzla Cantonal Court also sentenced six offenders to a total of 74 years of imprisonment, a historical first for the judicial system in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Social programs dedicated to assisting children involved in forced begging do not have adequate resources, and representatives from the Ministries of Labor are not included in the National Anti-Trafficking Strike Force, which limits coordination efforts. Furthermore, most child labor is in the informal sector, and laws on the minimum age for work do not meet international standards because they do not apply to children who are self-employed or those working outside of formal employment relationships.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Botswana made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified the International Labor Organization's Labor Inspection Convention and the Labor Inspection (Agriculture) Convention, which outline mandates to promote effective labor inspection systems, including in the agricultural sector in which child labor is prevalent in the country. The Ministry of Labor also provided comprehensive information on its labor law enforcement efforts and partnered with a local non-governmental organization to conduct targeted inspections in key districts where there have been reports of child labor on commercial farms and cattle posts. However, children in Botswana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in cattle herding and domestic work. Key gaps remain in the country’s legal framework, including the lack of a minimum age for compulsory education and a list of hazardous work activities for children. The government also did not provide information on its criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. In addition, the design and implementation of social programs to address child labor are insufficient to fully address the scope of the problem, especially in commercial sexual exploitation, cattle herding, and domestic work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Brazil made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published two updates to the national "Dirty List," which contains data on employers that the Ministry of Labor and Employment found to be using slave labor, including that of children. The updated lists were published in April and October for a total of 184 newly listed employers. The Secretariat of Labor Inspection conducted over 1,368 child labor specific operations which resulted in the removal of 2,317 children from situations of child labor; the numbers of operations and rescues were the highest recorded in the last six years. Additionally, the government launched the Information System for Confronting Human Trafficking, which aims to generate data on the purposes for and forms of recruitment, improve responses in addressing these crimes, and allow for detailed information on victims of human trafficking to be recorded. The Rio de Janeiro City government also launched the first Municipal Plan to Combat the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, which includes awareness campaigns to address and eradicate child labor. In addition, the Auxílio Brasil cash transfer program reached unprecedented levels by extending assistance to over 21.5 million families. However, children in Brazil are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Although Brazil made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions against child trafficking require the use of threats, violence, coercion, fraud, or abuse be established for the crime of child trafficking to have occurred and, therefore, do not meet international labor standards. The reported number of labor inspectors is also likely not sufficient to provide adequate coverage of the workforce, and local governments lack the capacity to fully implement and monitor the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor and other social protection programs.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the British Virgin Islands, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. There is no list of hazardous work prohibited for children in the British Virgin Islands, nor does the law criminalize the use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum age for work of 16 years old is lower than the compulsory education age of 17 years old.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Burkina Faso made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. On September 12, 2022, the government adopted a handover protocol in collaboration with the UN, which considers child soldiers as victims and directs officials to transfer them to social services by security forces if detained following military operations. The government also developed a mobile application for labor inspectors that will provide real-time data and information on child labor throughout the country and translated its hazardous work list for children into five local languages. Lastly, the government adopted the 2023–2027 Strategic Plan on Eliminating Child and Forced Labor in the Cotton, Textile, and Garment Value Chains. However, children in Burkina Faso are subjected to the worst forms of child labor,  including in farming and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in artisanal gold mining. The Labor Code does not identify the light work activities in which children may engage. The government also lacked resources for the enforcement of child labor laws and did not release information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Burma is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. During the reporting period, the regime’s military continued to force civilians, including children, to work in non-combat roles as porters, cleaners, cooks, and agricultural laborers in conflict areas. Otherwise, the government made efforts by enacting the Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons Law, which establishes that a child trafficking offense does not require a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion. Children in Burma are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced recruitment of children for use in armed conflict by armed groups, and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The vulnerability of Rohingya children to the worst forms of child labor remained high as many continued to be denied access to education and livelihoods because of restrictions on their movements imposed by the regime. The regime also has not published a hazardous work list of activities prohibited for children, as required by the Child Rights Law. In addition, the regime did not publish information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Burundi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Burundian government significantly increased funding for labor inspections, a fourteen-fold increase from 2021. The government, in collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund, also developed a national strategy to increase the integration of Batwa children into schools. Furthermore, members of Burundi's newly formalized Consultation and Monitoring Commission on Prevention and Repression of Trafficking in Persons completed a draft of a new national action plan on human trafficking, pending approval from authorities and final adoption by the Office of the Prime Minister. However, children in Burundi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Burundi's laws do not establish a compulsory education age. And while Burundi has a policy-based compulsory education age of 15, this is lower than its minimum age for work, 16, leaving children vulnerable to labor exploitation. The government also failed to provide comprehensive criminal law enforcement data related to the worst forms of child labor and lacked resources to conduct labor inspections and criminal investigations. Lastly, Burundi has insufficient social programs to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Cabo Verde made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.The General Legal Framework for the Protection of Children and Adolescents was approved by legislators during the reporting period. The Framework contains provisions addressing forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation and formalizes procedures for addressing situations in which children or adolescents are in danger.The government also reported its first worst forms of child labor conviction in recent years, imposing a 10-year sentence against an individual for the commercial sexual exploitation of a 14-year-old child. Additionally, the government began working on a new National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and the Cabo Verdean Institute for Children and Adolescents and the National Statistics Institute conducted a survey on children, which included statistics on child labor. However, children in Cabo Verde are subjected to the worst forms of  child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although Cabo Verde made efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws prohibiting forced labor are not sufficient as they do not criminalize practices similar to slavery or debt bondage and forced or compulsory labor. In addition, coordination among law enforcement agencies is limited and social programs to assist children involved in agriculture and domestic work are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Cambodia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Cambodia launched and committed $10 million to the National Action Plan on Early Childhood Care and Development, which aims to provide equitable and inclusive early childhood education and prioritizes an expansion of early learning curriculum, improved teaching materials, and a strengthened preschool workforce. Cambodia's Inter-Ministries Technical Working Group also drafted the Child Protection Law, which outlines children's rights and provides detailed information on how officials should conduct child-centered case management and referrals to social services. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Cambodia is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to take active measures to investigate, prosecute, convict, and sentence public officials who participate in or facilitate the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation of children and debt-based forced labor in brick kilns. In addition, judges, police, and labor inspectors were reported to have accepted bribes to overlook child labor offenses in the country, especially when the perpetrator had alleged ties with the government. Children in Cambodia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced labor in brickmaking. The government also failed to publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts. Moreover, the lack of regulation in the microfinance industry has led to debt bondage and an increase in child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Cameroon made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Officials from the East Regional Delegate of the Ministry of Social Affairs identified 3,000 children engaged in child labor at 46 mining sites. In addition, the government inaugurated a new anti-trafficking hotline, 1503, in cooperation with the International Organization for Migration. Finally, the Government of Cameroon supported access to education by distributing 1,803,906 free textbooks to students at 13,000 primary schools and hiring an additional 3,000 primary school teachers. However, children in Cameroon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in recruitment by non-state armed groups for use in conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cocoa production and gold mining. The government has not addressed gaps in Cameroon's legal framework regarding the prohibition of use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs, and the prohibition of the recruitment of children under age 18 by non-state armed groups. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, the Central African Republic made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed and ratified a Trafficking in Persons Law, which creates a prosecutorial framework specifically for trafficking offenses, and establishes broad protections and services for trafficking victims, regardless of their immigration status. In addition, the government issued a circular to help prevent the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. The government also established a National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Children, which includes a specific focus on preventing children from being recruited and used in conflict. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Central African Republic is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. Government security forces used children in support roles at isolated checkpoints during the reporting period in violation of national law. The government also coordinated with an armed group that recruited and used children in armed conflict, and some children accused of aiding armed groups were detained, although the government eventually released them in December. Children in the Central African Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use in armed conflict, and forced labor in diamond mining. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic work. The government did not publish complete data on its civil and criminal child labor law enforcement efforts in 2022, and enforcement agencies are understaffed and underfunded. Lastly, the Central African Republic lacks both a coordinating body and policies that address all relevant forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Chad made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government collaborated with the United Nations Children's Fund and the European Union to modernize the civil registry with the aim of increasing access to birth registration. In February 2022, the government also ratified the International Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. However, children in Chad are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in domestic work and cattle herding. The government did not provide sufficient data on law enforcement efforts and does not have policies or programs to address all worst forms of child labor in the country, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Chile made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Chile passed laws that specifically prohibit the use of children in illicit activities, raised the maximum prison sentences for those guilty of committing child trafficking crimes, and guaranteed the rights of children to be protected from economic exploitation. The Ministerial Advisory Commission for the Eradiation of Child Labor and Protection of Working Adolescents held several meetings on inspection guidelines for the labor directorate, which resulted in the creation of a manual and training modules on child labor and migration for enforcement personnel. In addition, Chile participated in the Alliance 8.7 Strategic Workshop as a Pioneer Country to renew its roadmap for attaining sustainable development goal 8.7. However, children in Chile are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children are also subjected to involvement in the production and trafficking of drugs. Furthermore, migrant children face significant barriers to education, including discrimination and a lack of transportation and access to educational settings.There is also a lack of adequate shelters for child survivors of trafficking in persons.</Description>

    <Description>For the 2022 reporting period, no assessment has been made regarding Christmas Island's efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because there is no evidence of a worst forms of child labor problem and the country has an adequate legal and enforcement framework on child labor. During the reporting period, the Work Health and Safety Act 2020 took effect, which increased protections for children 16 and 17 years old working in mines for the purposes of apprenticeships. In addition, the Government of Australia ratified the International Labor Organization Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention of 1930. In June 2023, the Government ratified the ILO's Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), which will enter into force on June 13, 2024. Finally, the Government of Australia issued its annual report detailing efforts to carry out the Modern Slavery Act and continued to fund cash assistance programs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Colombia made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Through Law 2205, the government amended the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prioritizes and accelerates investigations into commercial sexual exploitation and the use of children in pornography by establishing a prosecution timeline for the Attorney General's Office. The government also increased the number of labor inspectors from 885 to 1,165, developed an elite group of inspectors to focus on child labor, and increased the capacity of labor inspectors to identify children at risk. Furthermore, the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare established a 2023 Action Plan with Ecuadorian authorities to address child labor in illegal mining operations. Lastly, the government increased Venezuelan migrant children's enrollment in the education system by approximately 20 percent compared to the year prior. However, children in Colombia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, inadequate resource allocation for the labor inspectorate, including an insufficient number of labor inspectors, may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Finally, existing social programs are insufficient to address the scope of the worst forms of child labor in Colombia, including commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Comoros made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a National Brigade for the Repression of Illegal Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons, and the National Committee on the Prevention of Illegal Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons to bolster its anti-trafficking efforts. In addition, it doubled the number of labor inspections carried out in 2022 compared to the previous year. However, children in Comoros are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. Comoros' Labor Code applies only to workers with a formal work agreement, leaving child laborers, particularly those in the informal sector, vulnerable to exploitation. In addition, the legal framework defines child trafficking as requiring the use of force, fraud, or coercion, which does not conform with international standards. Finally, Comoros lacks a policy that addresses all relevant worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In October, the Inter‐ministerial Commission to Combat Child Labor in Mines and Artisanal Mining Sites launched the Child Labor Monitoring System. Moreover, the Ministry of Labor began recruiting 2,000 labor inspectors and controllers, some of whom will be trained to conduct inspections in mine sites. President Felix Tshisekedi also promulgated Law No° 22/067 for the Prevention and Fight Against Trafficking in Persons, which criminalizes all forms of trafficking and prescribes stringent penalties, addressing gaps that existed in the previous legal framework. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because of the national army’s complicity in the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo supplied weapons and munitions to non-state armed groups known for recruiting children. Children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are also subjected to other forms of the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, tin ore (cassiterite), tantalum ore (coltan), and tungsten ore (wolframite), and are used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups. Children also mine cobalt ore (heterogenite) in the Copperbelt region. The government did not publish labor or criminal law enforcement data. It also failed to take active measures to ensure that children are not inappropriately incarcerated, penalized, or physically harmed solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their exploitation in the worst forms of child labor. Other gaps remain, including a lack of sufficient numbers of enforcement personnel, insufficient training for enforcement personnel, limited financial resources, and poor coordination of government efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Republic of the Congo made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a Child Protection Action Plan, which includes measures for assisting child trafficking survivors. In addition, child labor data were published in June 2022, resulting from a nationwide study carried out by the Ministry of Social Affairs, Humanitarian Action and Solidarity in coordination with the United Nations Children's Fund. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks such as working in mines and stone quarries. The government has yet to accede to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, and existing social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor in all relevant sectors. In addition, the country lacks a national policy to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Cook Islands, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor.  The government partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund to launch the Pacific Islands Inclusive Educational Review to ensure that all children, including those with disabilities, have access to quality education. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution; the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Additionally, while the Cook Islands provides free education to citizens, permanent residents, and children of permanent residents, children outside of these categories must pay a school fee.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Costa Rica made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a plan to eradicate all forms of child labor in Costa Rica by 2025 and conducted virtual and in-person training to strengthen awareness, prevention, and the culture of reporting on child labor issues. The Office for the Eradication of Child Labor and Protection of the Adolescent Worker also provided assistance to minors withdrawn from exploitative labor by referring them to the cash transfer program for adolescent workers. However, children in Costa Rica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee.Lastly, research indicates that Costa Rica does not have an adequate number of labor inspectors to carry out inspection duties and it lacks sufficient financial resources to be able to carry out labor and criminal enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Côte d’Ivoire made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ivoirian government conducted 9,471 inspections, a 234 percent increase from the previous year, and recruited 100 additional child labor agents to track instances of child labor on cocoa farms and production zones. The government also officially created the National Sustainable Cocoa Committee (Comité National du Cacao Durable, CNCD), which is designed to implement the National Strategic Plan to address deforestation, child labor, and the low incomes of cocoa farmers. In addition, the government opened 91 new secondary schools, 517 new primary schools, and 227 new preschools during the reporting period. However, children in Côte d’Ivoire are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee. The government does not have a mechanism to assess civil penalties for labor law violations, and the lack of financial resources and personnel may have hindered labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Djibouti made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government signed a presidential decree mandating the establishment of the National Committee to Fight Against Trafficking and Similar Practices and, in partnership with the International Organization for Migration, established and opened the Center for Unaccompanied Children and Vulnerable Migrants, which provides mental health and medical support, legal assistance, shelter, food, and clothes to vulnerable young migrants. The Ministry of Women and Families also conducted a study on children living in the street in Djibouti City, which included information about the prevalence and conditions of forced child labor. However, children in Djibouti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in street work. Minimum age provisions apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards. In addition, the government did not make adequate efforts to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor due to a lack of financial and human resource allocations and reporting mechanisms. Finally, the government did not publish data on criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Dominica, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government funded and participated in programs that may contribute to preventing child labor, including fundraising for the Education Trust Fund and providing meals to students. However, the government's ability to prevent children from being subjected to the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not determine the types of hazardous work prohibited for children and the government has not enacted laws explicitly prohibiting the use of children in pornography. In addition, information on Dominica's criminal law enforcement efforts was notpublicly released.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, the Dominican Republic made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor approved a resolution prohibiting the employment of children under the age of 18 in domestic work, classifying this type of work as hazardous for minors. In addition, several government agencies signed a cooperation agreement to implement a new transportation program that facilitates school access in hard to reach areas. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Dominican Republic is assessed as having made minimal advancement because of a practice that delays advancement in the elimination of child labor.Numerous reports indicates school administrators have denied access to education to a significant number of children without identity documents. Children of Haitian origin or descent are being prevented from receiving social services, including access to the government's poverty reduction and vocational training programs. Children in the Dominican Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including forced labor in the production of bananas and other crops. Significant enforcement gaps remain, including limited human and financial resources for labor and criminal inspections and lack of authority to assess penalties for labor law violations. In addition, the Dominican Republic's prohibitionsrelated to trafficking are insufficient because they require threats, the use of force, or coercion to be established for the crime of child trafficking.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Ecuador made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Interior created the National Directorate for the Investigation of Crimes Against Women, Family, Children, Adolescents, Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling, which oversees law enforcement units responsible for investigating labor and sex trafficking cases that involve children. Further, the Ministry of Tourism approved a new Code of Conduct for tourism industry workers that includes actions meant to prevent the sexual exploitation of minors in tourist establishments. In addition, the government’s new social program, Inclusive Cities, brought protection services and temporary housing to 9,000 participants in 17 cities. However, children in Ecuador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. The Ministry of Labor has reported that the resources allocated to the labor inspectorate—including the number of inspectors, transportation, and equipment—is insufficient to conduct inspections in the informal sector. The Government of Ecuador has also not undertaken a nationwide child labor survey since 2012; the lack of current information on the prevalence of child labor hampers efforts to address the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Egypt made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved an updated National Strategy for Combating and Preventing Trafficking in Persons, which includes outcomes related to reducing child labor. The government also provided comprehensive criminal law enforcement data for inclusion in this report for the first time, and investigated 107 crimes involving 237 individuals, initiated 171 prosecutions, and achieved 70 convictions related to the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Egypt are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in quarrying limestone. The government did not publish data on its efforts to enforce its child labor laws, including labor inspectorate resources, number of child labor violations found, and penalties imposed for child labor violations. Additionally, programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem, particularly the lack of targeted programming to prevent and the commercial sexual exploitation of children and child labor limestone quarrying.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, El Salvador made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Labor Code to allow for higher fines to be imposed for child labor violations. The Trafficking in Persons Unit of the Attorney General's Office added 6 prosecutors for a total of 15. In addition, the National Council on the Trafficking of Persons carried out trainings for hospitality and emergency services hotline workers to enable them to better identify victims of human trafficking. However, children in El Salvador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and in illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of coffee. Law enforcement agencies throughout the country continue to lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws. Gaps also remain related to the lack of publicly available, comprehensive information on the government's labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Finally, social programs do not adequately address the full scope of the child labor problem in the country, particularly in the service sector.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Eritrea is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. Government officials continued to force students in grade 12, some of whom are under the age of 18, to participate in military training elements of the government's compulsory national service program. Otherwise, the government made efforts by increasing the number of its child wellbeing committees from 43 in 2021 to 67 in 2022. Children in Eritrea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced military training associated with national service, forced agricultural labor, and forced recruitment by state armed groups for use in armed conflict. In addition, Eritrea's minimum age protections do not apply to children working outside formal employment relationships, and laws do not criminally prohibit the use of a child for prostitution; the use, procuring, or offering of a child in illicit activities; or the procuring or offering of a child for pornography or pornographic performances. Moreover, the government does not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Eswatini made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security began conducting a review of their offices with the International Labor Organization to evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts in addressing child labor. However, children in Eswatini are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, forced livestock herding, and commercial sexual exploitation. Significant gaps in the legal framework remain, including a lack of legislation regulating the labor conditions under Kuhlehla and other customary practices.In addition, thede facto compulsory education age does not meet international standards.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Ethiopia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government supported a study of child domestic servitude to learn how to better prevent this form of forced child labor. The Ministry of Justice also worked with the International Organization for Migration to launch new standard operating procedures to identify potential victims of human trafficking and refer them to services. However, children in Ethiopia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in traditional weaving. Ethiopian law does not include free basic education or a compulsory age for education, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Additionally, social programs to address child labor have not sufficiently targeted sectors with high incidences of child labor, including agriculture and domestic work. </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) also continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to prevent child labor. There is no functioning labor inspectorate in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) to enforce labor laws. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the minimum age of 14 for work and 16 for hazardous workare not in complianceinternational standards, and the law does not prohibit adults from using, procuring, and offering a child for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Fiji made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics carried out a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in 2021 and published the results in August 2022, providing new information on the prevalence of children engaged in child labor, including hazardous work. Additionally, the government convicted a child sex trafficker, resulting in a prison sentence.However, children in Fiji are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Fiji's light work provisions are not specific enough to prevent children from being involved in child labor. Furthermore, the government lacks social programs to provide services to children exploited in commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic work.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Gabon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government worked with the United Nations Children's Fund on a campaign to provide birth certificates to more than 10,000 children, and increased funding, bed capacity, and in-kind support for shelters. However, despite government initiatives to address child labor, Gabon is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to provide evidence it conducted worksite inspections during the reporting period. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to child labor. Children in Gabon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. Furthermore, Gabonese law regarding minimum age for work provisions only applies to children in formal employment relationships, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age for work. In addition, Gabon does not have a policy that addresses all relevant forms of child labor and lacks social programs to address child labor in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Gambia The made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Nigeria to coordinate efforts to address the trafficking of women and children. It also provided information regarding its criminal law enforcement activities during the reporting period. In addition, the government launched four centers to provide services to survivors of gender-based violence and trafficking in persons, including child victims. However, children in Gambia The are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Gaps in the law remain, including that the minimum age for work of 18 years old is higher than the compulsory education age of 16 years old. Gambia The also lacked resources to conduct adequate enforcement efforts and has insufficient social programs to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Georgia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Labor Inspectorate created a group of expert labor inspectors to identify instances of forced labor and trafficking for labor exploitation and opened branch offices in Batumi and Kutaisi to increase its operational presence in Western Georgia. The Prosecutor’s Office adopted a new strategy for 2022–2027 to increase efforts to identify and effectively prosecute child trafficking and labor exploitation by using a victim-centered approach. In addition, the government approved a new National Strategy for the Protection of Human Rights in Georgia for 2022–2030, with a focus on protection of the rights of certain vulnerable groups, including children.  However, children in Georgia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced begging. Children also engage in agricultural labor. Georgia's minimum age for work does not meet international standards because it does not apply to children working in the informal sector. The Criminal Code does not explicitly prohibit the use of children in illicit activities. Furthermore, lack of effective coordination between the entities involved in addressing human trafficking hinders efforts to adequately assist child victims.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Ghana made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the number of labor inspectors from 48 to 189 and labor inspections from 749 to 1,108. The government also supported the Alliance on Sustainable Cocoa, which works to improve the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of cocoa production and trade, including by addressing child labor. In addition, it improved its data sharing efforts with non-governmental organizations and other countries by providing timely responses to requests for information. However, children in Ghana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in fishing and cocoa production. Prohibitions related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards because protections do not extend to live performances. Ghana also does not prohibit the use of children for illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the government has not acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. Lastly, resource constraints severely limited the government's ability to adequately enforce labor laws and implement social programs.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Grenada, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government's ability to prevent children from being subjected to the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws require the use of force, threats, abuse of power, or other forms of coercion, and therefore do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking. Grenada has also not identified activities prohibited for children or criminally prohibited the use, procuring, or offering of a child for all forms of commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the government has not published data on labor inspectorate funding.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guatemala made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted a decree amending the Penal Code to include and increase the penalties for online commercial sexual exploitation crimes committed against children. The Labor Inspectorate also increased the number of its human rights inspectors from 4 to 11, whose purview includes child labor issues. In addition, the government relaunched the "Protecting our Greatest Treasure" media campaign to raise awareness of protecting children and adolescents from sexual exploitation and human trafficking in the tourism sector. However, children in Guatemala are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Moreover, in Guatemala an insufficient number of labor inspectors limits the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare's ability to address child labor. In addition, existing social programs are insufficient to reach all children engaged in exploitative labor, particularly those engaged in domestic work or agriculture.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guinea made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government substantially increased the budget of the labor inspectorate compared to the previous year. In addition, the government opened shelters for trafficking survivors, including child survivors, in Conakry and N’Zérékoré, and initiated a new trafficking in persons program with the International Organization for Migration. However, children in Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in artisanal mining and forced begging. Laws related to the minimum age for work do not meet international standards because they do not include children working outside of a formal employment relationship or children who are self-employed. The government also lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor, and social programs do not address the extent of the child labor problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guinea-Bissau made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Guard began training border officials on how to detect human trafficking situations and created grassroots committees within villages near border locations to aid in identifying human traffickers using illegal border crossings. The newly developed case management and referral system, under the lead of the National Institute for Women and Children, was also used by 28 institutions during the reporting period, and although the National Emergency Plan for the Prevention and Combat of Trafficking in Persons expired in 2021, it continued to be implemented and contributed toward the identification and reintegration of 198 child trafficking victims at the national and transnational levels. However, children in Guinea-Bissau are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Prohibitions against the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards since the prostitution of children is not criminally prohibited in the country's legal framework. In addition, even though a new labor code was put into effect in 2022, the minimum age for work is not in compliance with international standards since the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children without a work contract. Furthermore, law enforcement officials do not receive sufficient resources to adequately conduct inspections and prosecute cases of child labor, and social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guyana made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government funded a training program for 1,661 officials and civil society representatives on human trafficking issues and increased funding from $100 to $125 for vouchers to purchase school uniforms, shoes, and backpacks . However, children in Guyana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Guyana does not meet the international standard for hazardous work for children because it allows children ages 16 to 17 to conduct night work in industrial activities. Guyanese law does not sufficiently prohibit all commercial sexual exploitation of children because it does not prohibit the use of children for prostitution, although it prohibits other forms of sexual exploitation of children. In addition, law enforcement agencies have insufficient resources to conduct inspections in remote areas, including a lack of transportation and accommodation, and struggle to prosecute cases even with abundant evidence. The government did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Haiti made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government certified 29 new labor inspectors and trained them on child labor issuesin the informal sector. Additionally, with the support of the United Nations Children’s Fund, the government created a new coordination mechanism dedicated to child protection issues. However, children in Haiti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and domestic work. Minimum age protections for work apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards requiring all children to be protected. In addition, Haiti lacks a clear minimum age for domestic work and a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. Likewise, social programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem, particularly in domestic work, agriculture, and child trafficking.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Honduras made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Commission for the Gradual and Progressive Eradication of Child Labor updated the hazardous work list, which awaits ministerial approval, and held a public expo to raise awareness of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security also approved the creation of a child labor seal to incentivize the private sector to implement good practices and promote compliance with child labor prohibitions. In addition, the government replaced the Better Life Voucher program with the Solidarity Network conditional cash transfer program for families in some of the poorest towns in the country to ensure children stay in school. However, children in Honduras are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. They are also used to carry out illicit activities, including selling and trafficking drugs. Children also engage in child labor in the production of coffee, melons, and lobsters. Labor law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandates, identifying no child labor law violations in 2022 and decreasing the number of criminal investigations conducted and prosecutions initiated compared with the previous reporting period. Additionally, social programs that aim to address child labor in agriculture have failed to address the problem, and other social programs are needed to address child labor in fishing, mining, domestic work, and forced begging.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, India made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Railway Protection Force launched a nationwide campaign that intercepted 183 children from human trafficking perpetrated on trains and in railway stations. In Haryana, the police department removed 1,760 children from child labor, while the Haryana state Anti-Human Trafficking Unit reunited 378 child trafficking victims with their families. Additionally, from April 2021- March 2022, the National Child Labor Project Scheme removed and rehabilitated 13,271 from child labor. However, children in India are vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in garment production, stone quarrying, and brickmaking. Existing hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work for long periods in unsafe and unhealthy environments, and penalties for illegally employing children are insufficient to deter violations. Reports of corruption at varying levels among police and other government officials, leading to the mistreatment of victims and delayed prosecutions of child labor offenses remained a concern. Children continue to experience commercial sexual exploitation and other forms of abuse in shelter homes that operate without sufficient government oversight. In addition, the Government of India continued to restrict foreign donations to NGOs, many of which work on human and child rights issues, through an amendment to the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. The authorities sometimes used the threat of cancelling or revoking this Act to silence or restrict civil society organizations that might be working to address human rights concerns, including the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Indonesia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection, together with the United Nations Children's Fund, launched the Prevention of Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse program, a 3-year partnership in response to a report on Indonesian children being victims of online sexual exploitation. The Ministry of Manpower also increased funding for the labor inspectorate from $12.2 million in 2021 to $15.1 million in 2022, and increased its number of labor inspectors by 267, for a total of 1,570. However, children in Indonesia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in plantation agriculture, including in palm oil and tobacco production. Despite increases in funding and inspectors in 2022, the Ministry of Manpower continues to lack the financial resources and personnel necessary to fully enforce child labor laws throughout the country. In addition, Indonesia's prohibitions against child trafficking are inconsistent with international law because the Law on the Eradication of the Criminal Act of Trafficking in Persons requires that a demonstration of threats, the use of force, or coercion be established for the crime of child trafficking to have occurred.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Iraq made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs' Child Labor Unit identified 109 children under the age of 15 engaging in child labor and 604 children under the age of 18 working in hazardous conditions, although it is unknown whether these children were provided with social services after they were identified. Despite this effort, Iraq is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. During the reporting period, Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government authorities inappropriately detained or punished children allegedly affiliated with ISIS—some of whom were victims of forcible recruitment or use. Children in Iraq are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. The government also did not provide information on its criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. In addition, it continues to lack social programs that focus on assisting children involved in child labor, including demobilizing and reintegrating child soldiers.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Moderate Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Jamaica made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security increased the number of labor inspections from 1,679 in 2021 to 2,319 in 2022. It also drafted a new policy to reduce child labor through 2027 that awaits Cabinet approval. In addition, the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons signed a cooperation agreement with government departments and NGOs to collect and report national human trafficking data. However, children in Jamaica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and use in illicit activities. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and street work. Jamaica's laws do not provide higher penalties for using, procuring, or offering children for the production and distribution of drugs than penalties imposed for these same crimes when the victims are adults. Moreover, the law providing for free basic education does not meet international standards because free education is only guaranteed for Jamaican citizens.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Jordan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Penal Code to increase penalties for enabling or encouraging a child under the age of 16 to beg or collect donations, including imprisonment of not less than 2 years for forced child begging. The government also investigated 42 cases involving the use of children in the production and trafficking of drugs and updated the National Framework for the Reduction of Child Labor, extending it to 2030. However, children in Jordan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and use in illicit activities, including drug trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Moreover, Syrian children still face barriers to accessing education due to socioeconomic pressures, bullying, and the costs associated with transportation and supplies, among other issues. In addition, the scope of government programs is insufficient to fully address the extent of child labor, including in construction and street vending.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Kazakhstan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government provided data on labor inspectorate funding for the first time since 2020 and increased that funding significantly. Training for labor inspectors was also provided, and new courses were created on the identification and remediation of child labor, including child trafficking. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Kazakhstan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued the implementation of the revised Entrepreneurial Code that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. On December 30, 2021, the President of Kazakhstan signed a law significantly restricting the circumstances under which unannounced inspections can be performed. The new law, which came into effect on January 1, 2023, codifies and expands the government’s existing practice under which unannounced inspections are prohibited in all cases, except in the presence of compelling grounds, and supporting evidence enclosed to such a complaint, or if an inspection is mandated by judicial or tax authorities. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Children in Kazakhstan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in markets. The government lacks current, comprehensive, and detailed research on child labor, including in cotton production. In addition, the government extended a moratorium through December 2022 under which labor inspections of small enterprises were permitted only in cases that pose a mass threat to life and health, law and social order, or national security.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Kenya made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted the Children's Act, strengthening legal protections for children from child labor, including mandating the development of a light work framework, and outlining child protection mandates of government agencies, such as protecting children from armed conflict. In addition, the government substantially increased the number of worksite inspections for the reporting period, while achieving convictions and imposing sentences on two individuals for crimes related to human trafficking of children. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Kenya is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Elements within the Kenyan Defense Forces likely sustained in-kind support of a Somali federal member state group that has been implicated in the recruitment and use of child soldiers. Children in Kenya are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic service. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Key coordinating committees related to the elimination of child labor lack adequate resources to carry out their mandates, and the labor inspectorate does not have sufficient financial and human resources, affecting its ability to ensure that child labor laws are enforced.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Kiribati made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2022, the Ministry of Women, Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs launched a child protection case management and referral system called SafeNet, which allows personnel from the government, churches, and NGOs to share information and assist child victims, including those found in exploitive situations. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Kiribati are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Existing laws do not identify hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children. The law also does not specify the conditions under which light work can be undertaken. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Kosovo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted the Law on Crime Victim Compensation, which expands the existing victims' compensation program and assists child victims of human trafficking and forced labor. Additionally, it adopted the Strategy for Advancement of the Rights of Roma and Ashkali Communities 2022–2024 that includes a focus on providing inclusive education for children from these communities. The government also worked with Save the Children to develop manuals for social services providers, which resulted in improved communications between providers when assisting vulnerable children. However, children in Kosovo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work, including begging and loading and transporting goods. The Labor Inspectorate and Centers for Social Work face financial and human resource constraints, which may impede their ability to adequately address child labor. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, the Kyrgyz Republic made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Internal Affairs continued to conduct raids of businesses at high risk for labor law violations, including raids to identify vulnerable children and child labor. The Criminal Code was also amended to strengthen penalties for sexual abuse of children or involving children in illicit activities. In addition, the government funded the construction and staffing of 31 new schools to improve educational access. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Kazakhstan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement. A new moratorium on labor inspections was put into place from January 1 through December 31, 2023. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Children in the Kyrgyz Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Minimum age protections are not extended to children engaged in non-contractual employment, and research indicated that labor law enforcement efforts are not targeted to all sectors in which children are vulnerable to child labor, especially agriculture. In addition, the scope of social programs to address child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Lebanon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In June 2022, the United Nations Children's Fund expanded a national grant for children called Haddi. The program provides cash assistance to children at risk of child labor and child marriage, and to children with disabilities, children in non-formal education, and children needing nutrition support. However, children in Lebanon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced labor in agriculture. Children also engage in child labor in the production of potatoes and tobacco. Furthermore, government officials continued to indicate that governmental funding is insufficient to properly carry out their duties. In addition, Lebanese law prohibits inspectors from inspecting informal workplaces, where the majority of child labor occurs, and social programs targeting child labor remained insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Lesotho made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Lesotho organized 17 radio programs and 39 school seminars with a focus on human trafficking and finalized a report with recommendations on how to improve the criminal justice system's response to human trafficking. The government also placed additional officers at the Moshoeshoe International Airport to help identify human trafficking victims and the Lesotho Police Forces rescued four girls from being trafficked. However, children in Lesotho are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in animal herding. Lesotho's compulsory education age of 13 is below the minimum age for work, which is 15, leaving children between these ages vulnerable to child labor. The government also lacks effective coordination mechanisms to address child labor, and labor inspections are not conducted in high-risk sectors, including the informal sector, in which child labor is prevalent.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Liberia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government signed a new hazardous work list, which identified specific occupations and tasks prohibited for children, including sugarcane cleaning and harvesting, rubber tapping, palm cutting, bush clearing, and harvesting cocoa. The government also almost doubled the number of labor inspections it conducted, from 556 in 2021 to 1,044 in 2022. Finally, the government designed Standard Operating Procedures to guide the operations of Liberia's child labor monitoring systems at the district level. However, children in Liberia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of rubber and the mining of gold and diamonds. Liberia has yet to accede to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict or the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. Moreover, social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Madagascar made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a new national action plan on trafficking in persons, and the Regional Committee in the Fight Against Child Labor of Fianarantsoa conducted field visits to markets, brickmaking sites, and stone quarries to monitor child labor and raise awareness among parents. In 2022, for the first time in several years, the Ministry of Labor also compiled reports from 11 of its regional offices on child labor-related activities between 2019 and 2021, which identified 922 children working in various sectors. Finally, the government expanded daily school meals from roughly 1,200 to 2,209 public primary schools. Although Madagascar made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, the government failed to investigate reports of some officials accepting bribes to produce and issue false identity documents to facilitate the commercial sexual exploitation of minors. Children in Madagascar are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the mica mining sector and in agriculture, including in the production of vanilla. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor, and Madagascar does not have a current national action plan for the elimination of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Malawi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Criminal law enforcement officials increased the number of convictions related to the worst forms of child labor and participated in ten trainings on laws protecting children from child labor. In addition, Malawi's Ministry of Labor began piloting a child labor monitoring system to enhance data collection, identification of working children through school attendance data, and improve coordination within the tobacco sector. However, children in Malawi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in the farming of tobacco and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Despite its legal abolition, many families are still working under the tenancy system, which frequently leads to these families and their children falling into situations of debt bondage. In addition, minimum age protections do not cover children working in domestic households or non-commercial farms.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Maldives made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the number of labor inspections from 124 inspections in 2021 to 656 in 2022. It also increased the budget for labor inspections and the number of labor inspectors from 23 to 32. Moreover, the government began conducting a baseline study on trafficking in persons throughout the country's atolls. However, children in Maldives are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, illicit activities, and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work.Information on children's work is limited because a national survey on child labor has not been conducted. Laws in Maldives also do not sufficiently prohibit commercial sexual exploitation because the use, procurement, and offering of a child for pornographic performances are not criminally prohibited. In addition, criminal enforcement agencies did not publish statistics on the number of investigations conducted, prosecutions initiated, convictions achieved, and penalties imposed for violations related to child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Mali made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The transition government recruited three additional labor inspectors. However, despite this initiative to address child labor, Mali is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The transition government used children in its armed forces during the reporting period in violation of national law. Children in Mali are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in the production of cotton and rice, and in artisanal gold mining. Although Mali's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Law criminalizes trafficking for the purpose of slavery, it does not more broadly criminalize the act of slavery. Malian law also does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, and allows children under the age of 18 to be penalized for acts they were forced to commit as a direct result of being recruited and used by armed groups. In addition, Mali lacks a national action plan to address all worst forms of child labor that exist in the country, and social and rehabilitation services remain inadequate for child labor victims.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Mauritania made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In February 2023, the government created the Instance Nationale, an organization mandated to combat hereditary slavery and human trafficking by coordinating cross-government efforts, cooperating with international partners, providing assistance to victims, maintaining a database of trafficking cases, and working with civil society organizations. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mauritania is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a law that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Mauritania’s Civil Status Code requires a copy of the biological parents’ marriage license for children to obtain a birth certificate. As a result, children born out of wedlock and many Haratine and Sub-Saharan ethnic minority children, including those of slave descent, have been prevented from being registered at birth. Because birth certificates are required for enrollment in secondary school in Mauritania, children as young as age 12 cannot access education, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mauritania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary slavery. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in herding cattle and goats. Research is needed on the prevalence of child labor in the country, and social programs are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem. In addition, the government did not publish comprehensive information about its labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Mauritius made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In January 2022, the government enacted three laws, the Children's Act 2020, the Children's Court Act 2020, and the Child Sex Offenders Register Act 2020, aimed at reinforcing the legal framework on the protection of children. The three laws intended to harmonize Mauritius' domestic laws with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. The government also increased its number of labor inspectors from 109 in 2021 to 164 in 2022 and adopted a 2022–2026 national action plan to combat human trafficking, with support from the International Organization of Migration. However, some children in Mauritius are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, including selling drugs. Children also engage in child labor in construction and street vending. The government should consider implementing policies and social programs to improve the standard of care and availability of housing for victims of child commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the police are in need of sufficient human resources, training in child-sensitive interview techniques, and adequate procedural mechanisms for investigation of child labor crimes, such as those involving commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, gaps remain in the implementation of key policies and social programs related to child labor, including the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Mexico made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the ratification of the International Labor Organization's Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention and increased the number of municipal-level bodies responsible for coordinating efforts to address child labor. In addition, the government's Benito Juárez Wellbeing National Scholarship Program reached 1.2 million more students in 2022 than in 2021. However, children in Mexico are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of chile peppers, coffee, sugarcane, and tomatoes. Although 55.2 percent of all employment in Mexico occurs in the informal sector, federal and some state-level labor inspectors carry out inspections in that sector only after receiving formal complaints. Further, the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare does not have an internal system to track cases of child labor violations, and the 529 labor inspectors in the country are likely insufficient to cover the country’s more than 57 million workers. Criminal law enforcement agencies also lack human and financial resources, and social programs to prevent and eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Moldova made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Moldova enacted a law in December 2022 which authorizes labor inspectors to perform onsite, unannounced inspections if inspectors have information or suspicion that certain types of labor violations may be taking place, including child labor and trafficking in persons. In addition, the government reactivated the National Council on the Protection of the Rights of Children, established a new National Program for Child Protection, and signed a joint order between three ministries to identify and assist children at risk of child labor. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet the international standard for the minimum age for work because the Labor Code’s minimum age provisions do not apply to all children working in the informal sector. Children in Moldova are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture.  </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Mongolia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Mongolia's revised Labor Law includes a formal prohibition of child labor exploitation and sets the minimum age for work at age 15. The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia also published a qualitative study on child labor with support from the International Labor Organization. In addition, under the Child Protection Compact Partnership, the government trained community social workers and educators on trafficking in persons prevention and victim identification. Children in Mongolia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in horse jockeying and mining. The revised Labor Law legalized unannounced labor inspections that can result in sanctions. However, confusion remains amongst inspectors on whether unannounced are permitted, which may impede enforcement of child labor laws. Lastly, due to a lack of training and formalized screening procedures, criminal law enforcement officials sometimes detain child victims of prostitution rather than referring them to social services.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Montenegro made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Montenegro increased cash benefit payments to families with children at risk for child labor and allocated funding for the construction of the country's first shelter dedicated to children who are survivors of human trafficking. However, children in Montenegro are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Research found that the scope of programs to address child labor in street work is insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Montserrat, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Montserrat also continued to implement a law that delays advancement to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Labor inspectors do not have the authority to conduct unannounced inspections, as they must obtain either the business owner's consent or a search warrant to enter a business for the purposes of performing an inspection. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. In addition, the Labor Code allows children as young as age 14 to engage in light work; however, Montserrat does not have a list of activities that constitute light work, nor does it specify the conditions under which light work may be undertaken or limit the number of hours for light work. Additionally, the government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children nor criminally prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government convicted five civil servants on charges related to the sexual exploitation of children or forced child labor. It also drafted a national strategy against human trafficking and developed a guide to help government ministries identify trafficking victims. Additionally, the government increased the number of labor inspectors by over 23 percent, from 404 in 2021 to 500 in 2022. However, children in Morocco are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation. The Labor Code's minimum age for work provisions do not meet international standards as children 15 years of age and under are not protected when working in traditional artisan and handicraft sectors. Furthermore, the scope of government social programs is insufficient as they do not fully address children exploited through domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Mozambique made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government convened its first annual National Conference on the Elimination of Child Labor and held awareness campaigns about child labor in all provinces. However, children in Mozambique are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in the production of tobacco. In addition, the established minimum age for work is not in compliance with international labor standards because it does not extend to informal employment. Lastly, existing social programs are insufficient to fully address the extent of the child labor problem in Mozambique.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Namibia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In March, the government launched the Social Protection Policy to provide a framework to strengthen existing protection mechanisms, including the Child Disability Grant and the Orphans and Vulnerable Children Grant, both of which provide monthly supplemental payments to children vulnerable to child labor. However, children in Namibia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in agricultural work, domestic work, and street work. Prevention and elimination of child labor are not integrated into key national policies, and social programs do not address child labor in agriculture and domestic work. The government also did not publish data on labor law or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Nepal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Nepal announced the liberation of the Haruwa-Charuwa agricultural bonded laborers and promised to establish a recovery program and provide restitution for this group. The police also removed 27 children exploited as bonded laborers from brick kilns in southern Nepal and the Nepal Child Rights Council provided assistance to 11,696  children across 47 districts through 417 children's homes. However, children in Nepal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in producing bricks. Nepal's law related to child trafficking is insufficient because it does not clearly criminalize recruitment, harboring, receipt, or transportation in the absence of force, fraud, or coercion. The law prohibiting the use of children in illicit activities is also insufficient because it does not prohibit the use of children in the production of drugs. In addition, the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security lacks sufficient resources and labor inspectors to adequately enforce laws related to child labor. Moreover, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Nicaragua made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established the new National Strategic Plan for the Prevention, Care, Investigation, Persecution, and Sanction of Human Trafficking. However, children in Nicaragua are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Laws do not establish a clear compulsory education age, and the government lacks adequate services for human trafficking survivors, such as shelters. In addition, labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandates. Furthermore, the government lacks a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Niger made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created a new committee to combat forced begging and held a workshop to revise the draft National Action Plan to Combat Child Labor. However, children in Niger are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and mining, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks herding livestock.  The minimum age for work does not meet international standards because it does not apply to children in informal work. In addition, the government made limited efforts to address the ongoing practice of wahaya, a form of child slavery that was upheld as illegal by a Nigerien court in 2019. Lastly, there are persistent gaps in labor law enforcement, including insufficient funding for labor inspectors to conduct inspections.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Nigeria made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Five additional Nigerian Governors signed the Child Rights Act, which provides free and compulsory education for children and prohibits the use of children in illicit activities and by non-state armed groups. The government also hired over 180 labor inspectors and increased inspections from 10,526 in 2021 to 17,026 in 2022. In addition, the government established 11 community child labor monitoring committees, which oversee child labor projects and outreach efforts at the local level. Finally, the government adopted a new national action plan on human trafficking and conducted a national child labor survey in order to better inform their child labor policies. However, children in Nigeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and use in armed conflict, as well as quarrying granite and artisanal mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, protections related to the minimum age for work do not apply to children who are self-employed or working in the informal economy. In addition, the state of Kano does not prohibit the use of children in illicit activities. </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Niue, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund to launch the Pacific Islands Inclusive Educational Review to ensure that all children, including those with disabilities, have access to quality education. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution; the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Niue has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found that no child labor exists on Norfolk Island, in 2022, the government made moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Government of Australia ratified the International Labor Organization Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention of 1930. In June 2023, the government ratified the ILO's Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), which will enter into force on June 13, 2024. Additionally, the Government of Norfolk Island began transitioning its states' services from New South Wales to Queensland, which is expected to be fully complete by December 31, 2026. However, the government has not established laws that sufficiently protect children from commercial sexual exploitation because the use of a child for prostitution is not prohibited.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, North Macedonia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Parliament of North Macedonia adopted the new Law on Compensation of Victims of Violent Crime which provides financial, medical, and psychosocial support for victims of crimes, including children. Additionally, in 2022 investigators and prosecutors from the Ministry of the Interior received trainings related to child labor and juvenile justice from the Academy for Judges and Prosecutors.However, children in North Macedonia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Additionally, the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Oman made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking launched a new website in English and Arabic with information on how to report human trafficking crimes in 14 languages. Additionally, in cooperation with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the government drafted a new law to address human trafficking. It also continued its prosecution of two foreign nationals suspected of exploiting a Pakistani child in commercial sexual exploitation under the Law to Combat Human Trafficking. Child labor is not visible in Oman, although a small number may work informally with their families, including in fishing and farming. Survey data are needed on the extent and nature of child labor to inform policies and programs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Pakistan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Pakistan amended existing laws by increasing penalties for crimes related to child trafficking, child pornography, and employing of child domestic workers. The Punjab Labor Department also conducted over 6,000 inspections at brick kilns, identified 239 child labor violations, and arrested 60 perpetrators. Lastly, the Sindh provincial government created a task force to review child labor laws and recommend amendments to fill gaps in current provincial legislation. However, children in Pakistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work, brick manufacturing, and agriculture. Pakistan's provincial labor inspectorates do not have sufficient human and financial resources, and enforcement data are unavailable. Furthermore, police corruption, particularly the taking of bribes from suspected perpetrators to ignore child labor crimes and a lack of willingness to conduct criminal investigations, hindered Pakistan's ability to address child labor throughout the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Panama made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Panama passed Law 285, establishing pecuniary penalties, suspension, and closure of commercial premises for companies found using child labor. The government also increased its number of labor inspectors from 105 to 198 and created new sub-committees to address child labor in the provinces of Chiriquí, Herrera, PanamáEast, andPanamáOeste. In addition, the government prepared a new five-year National Action Plan Against Trafficking in Person and developed a network of private sector companies committed to eradicating child labor. However, children in Panama are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, Panamanian law allows minors under age 16 to engage in hazardous work within training facilities in violation of international standards. Moreover, labor law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandates. Finally, existing social programs are insufficient to address the full scope of the child labor problem in the country, in particular for children living in rural areas and from indigenous and Afro-Panamanian communities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Papua New Guinea made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government reintroduced the Government Tuition Fee Subsidy Policy, which pledges to cover 100 percent of school fees for students. However, children in Papua New Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining and deep-sea fishing. Papua New Guinea's hazardous work prohibitions do not comply with international standards because they allow children ages 16 and older to engage in hazardous work, which is below the international standard of 18 years old. Papua New Guinea also does not have laws that sufficiently protect children from commercial sexual exploitation- because using, procuring, and offering a child for pornographic performances are not criminally prohibited. Papua New Guinea also does not have sufficient prohibitions against child trafficking because the law requires that threats, the use of force, or coercion be established for the crime of child trafficking. Moreover, although exact funding levels are unknown, the labor inspectorate does not have sufficient resources to adequately enforce Papua New Guinea's labor laws, including sufficient trainings for labor inspectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Paraguay made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created nine new committees to address child labor at the regional level and passed the National Plan for Childhood and Adolescence 2022–2024, which focuses government efforts to protect children and promote their rights, highlighting child labor as particular violations to the rights of children. In addition, the Public Ministry increased the number of prosecutions initiated of alleged child labor crimes from 47 in 2021 to 69 in 2022.  However, children in Paraguay are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic servitude and in debt bondage in cattle raising, on dairy farms, and in charcoal factories. Children with disabilities as well as those from rural and indigenous communities face difficulties accessing and completing their education. In addition, law enforcement agencies lack the funding and resources needed to sufficiently identify, investigate, and prosecute child labor crimes. Social programs also lack the funding and coverage needed to address child labor in rural areas.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Peru made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government added all agricultural activities to its hazardous work list for children and passed a new law, which imposed higher fines for cases of commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking. The government also trained 300 judges on child labor laws and nearly 1,500 government officials on preventing and eliminating trafficking in persons and forced labor. In addition, the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention, 1930, entered into force during the reporting year. However, children in Peru are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in the production of rice and Brazil nuts. Peruvian law allows children ages 12 to 14 to do light work without specifying the activities in which children may work. Labor law enforcement agencies in Peru still lack sufficient inspectors and training to adequately address child labor, and the government did not provide complete information on labor law and criminal enforcement efforts against child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Philippines made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act to hold private sector entities responsible for addressing human trafficking. It also enacted the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials Act, which, among other things, punishes perpetrators of online sexual abuse of children and provides penalties for the production, distribution, possession, and provision of access to child sexual abuse or exploitation materials. In addition, the government launched a plan to improve the quality and delivery of education, address access gaps, and build resilience of learners. However, children in the Philippines are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and gold mining. The minimum age for work of 15 is lower than the compulsory education age of 18, making children ages 15 through 17 vulnerable to child labor. Social programs also do not sufficiently support child victims of online sexual exploitation, and enforcement of child labor laws remains a challenge throughout the country due to limited personnel and financial resources.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Rwanda made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased labor inspectorate funding and conducted awareness-raising campaigns aimed at ending child labor, child abuse, and addressing human trafficking. However, children in Rwanda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in informal mining, including carrying heavy loads. Reports indicate that children subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and forced street begging have been detained by government officials in transit centers intended for individuals demonstrating so-called deviant behaviors, where they often experience physical abuse. In addition, inadequate resource allocation for the labor inspectorate, including an insufficient number of labor inspectors, may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Finally, social programs do not address all relevant sectors in which child labor is present.    </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. In 2022, the Government of Ascension enacted the Employment Ordinance, which details the conditions under which children may work, including acceptable work activities and hours. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha lacks a functioning labor inspectorate for the enforcement of labor laws and regulations. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha lacks legislation to criminally prohibit forced labor, debt bondage, slavery, and child trafficking. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Moderate Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Saint Lucia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government renewed its Trafficking in Persons National Action Plan through 2026 and launched a new Border Control Management System that will assist authorities in identifying trafficking in persons cases. Additionally, members of the Human Trafficking Task Force and the Royal Saint Lucia Police Force partnered with U.S. Homeland Security Investigations for training on trafficking in persons. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Lucia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Saint Lucia has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children and its laws do not sufficiently prohibit the commercial sexual exploitation of children.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed amendments to the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act to strengthen penalties for offenders. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines engage in child labor in agriculture. Gaps remain in the legal framework, as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines does not fully meet international standards because the use of children for prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances is not prohibited. In addition, the minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards and there is no legislation prohibiting the using, procuring, and offering of children in illicit activities, including in the production of drugs. The government also did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Samoa made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In partnership with the International Labor Organization, the government conducted a Rapid Assessment Survey of Child Vendors, finding a 27 percent increase compared to the same study conducted in 2015. It also provided information on its labor law and criminal law enforcement efforts, including the number of labor inspectors, for the first time for inclusion in this report. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Samoa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in street work, including begging and vending. Samoa lacks laws that prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Furthermore, as the minimum age for work of 15 is lower than the compulsory education age of 16, children in Samoa may be encouraged to leave school before the completion of compulsory education.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Sao Tome and Principe made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government continued to fund three centers run by NGOs that assist vulnerable families, orphans, and children living and working on the street. However, children in Sao Tome and Principe are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Labor Code does not apply to children working outside of a formal labor relationship, such as children who are self-employed. Moreover, limited financial resources hampered law enforcement efforts, and policies addressing the worst forms of child labor do not exist.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Senegal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the government developed and finalized new standard operating procedures on the identification and investigation of trafficking in persons cases. In an effort to prevent forced begging, the government also spent $603,000 to assist over 10,934 children in Koranic schools, or daaras, that met basic standards of care and child protection. Finally, it coordinated with the international partners in the launch of the Programs to Counter Sex Trafficking in Kédougou. However, children in Senegal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include domestic work or street work, areas in which there is evidence of potential harm to child workers. In addition, Senegal does not have a current national action plan, or a national coordinating body for the elimination of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Serbia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Center for the Protection of Trafficking Victims conducted trainings for educators, healthcare workers, and other social protection authorities on identifying potential victims of human trafficking. The government also approved the 2022 Plan to Protect Street Children in Situations of Violence, Neglect, and Exploitation, which defines hazardous street labor for children and sets guidelines for coordination between the Centers for Social Work, the Labor Inspectorate, the Basic and Higher Public Prosecutor's Offices, and educational and health institutions. However, children in Serbia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Serbia's laws do not treat forced child beggars as victims of child labor, and the country's social welfare centers are overburdened with cases, which limits efforts to provide services to survivors of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Sierra Leone made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed the Anti-Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling Act, which increased prison terms for sex trafficking and established a trust fund for survivors of human trafficking to pay for shelter, medical services, and legal aid. The government also launched a hotline to report trafficking crimes and established a National Migration Policy to promote the rights of migrants and increase public awareness of human trafficking. However, children in Sierra Leone are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in mining. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in quarrying stone and fishing. Sierra Leone's light work provisions do not specify the activities and conditions in which light work may be undertaken or limit the number of hours of light work, which does not meet international standards. In addition, Sierra Leone lacks a national policy and social program to address all relevant worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Solomon Islands made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of the Solomon Islands ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. Anational survey on the state of inclusive education was also conducted and a new national education action plan was launched. However, children in the Solomon Islands are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Research shows that children are also involved in the harvesting of palm oil fruits. The minimum age for work of 12 years does not meet the international standard of 14 years, and the Solomon Islands has not established a minimum age for hazardous work or delineated the types of work considered hazardous for children. Furthermore, there is no law that makes education compulsory, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor. The government also did not publish labor and criminal law enforcement data for the reporting year.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Somalia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement. The Somali police force participated in trainings conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime with the goal of increasing anti-trafficking efforts. Somaliland, which has self-declared independence from Somalia but is not recognized by any country, also criminalized human trafficking for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Somalia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. During the reporting period, there is evidence that federal and state security forces continued to recruit and use children in armed conflict, in violation of national law. In other cases, government security forces detained children for suspected association with armed groups, in some cases subjecting them to lengthy interrogations and coerced confessions. In addition, the government did not conduct worksite inspections in 2022. Children in Somalia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Somali laws do not criminally prohibit child labor trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, or the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups. Furthermore, the government did not provide complete information on its criminal law enforcement efforts to address the worst forms of child labor for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, South Africa made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. South Africa hosted the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labor, where delegates adopted the Durban Call to Action on Elimination of Child Labor. In addition, in August, the Department of Employment and Labor led a joint multi-departmental inspection effort that resulted in criminal child labor charges. The government also increased the benefit of the Child Support Grant by 4.3 percent and the Foster Care Grant by 1.9 percent, both of which provide direct cash transfers to reduce child vulnerability. However, children in South Africa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, in forced begging, and use in illicit activities. Social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor, and free basic education is not guaranteed by law.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, South Sudan is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, South Sudan is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. The country's military continued to recruit children, sometimes forcibly, to fight opposition groups, and for use in supporting roles. Otherwise, the government made efforts by extending until 2024 the Comprehensive Action Plan to Prevent All Grave Violations Against Children in South Sudan. In addition, for the first time since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Labor conducted labor inspections. However, children in South Sudan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in cattle herding. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. In 2022, the government did not hold perpetrators of child labor accountable and has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons. In addition, police continued to arrest and imprison children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation, rather than treating them as victims.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Sri Lanka made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Children and Young Persons Ordinance to raise the age of majority from 16 to 18 to align this law with international standards. The government worked with the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund to implement a $34 million campaign to support children's school attendance, nutrition, and safety in response to the economic crisis. The Sri Lankan Police also made criminal law enforcement data related to the worst forms of child labor publicly available for the first time. However, children in Sri Lanka are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Research indicates that some children in rural areas face barriers to accessing education, including difficulties in traveling to school, an inadequate number of teachers, and challenges with registration. Furthermore, the labor inspectorate lacked sufficient staffing and funding to carry out an adequate number of inspections, including in factories in the northern and eastern provinces.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Suriname made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Commission on Combating Child Labor translated television and radio programs into six languages and held awareness-raising sessions on child labor. The government also increased the number of convictions it secured for child labor crimes and signed bilateral and regional enforcement arrangements with French Guiana, Brazil, and Guyana that included language on joint efforts to combat cross-border criminal activities, including human trafficking. In addition, the government launched a program to provide inclusive access to all levels of education, with a specific focus on children in the interior and improving the quality of lower secondary education. However, children in Suriname are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining.  The compulsory education age does not reach the minimum age for employment, leaving some children vulnerable to labor exploitation. In addition, while Suriname's laws criminalize sexual acts with a minor under 16, they do not criminally prohibit the use of a child under 16 for commercial sex. The government did not report the number of child labor inspections it conducted.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the United Republic of Tanzania made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Mainland government made available, for the first time in several years, complete information on its labor law enforcement efforts, identifying 74 child labor violations through 4,800 worksite inspections. The government also created a new task force to enhance efforts to prevent and respond to human trafficking crimes, including those involving children, and allocated financial resources to support its National Strategy on the Elimination of Child Labor. However, children in Tanzania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in mining, quarrying, and domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain in the legal framework and enforcement of laws related to child labor, including lack of penalties for use of children in illicit activities, lack of minimum age protections for children engaged in domestic work, and an insufficient number of labor inspectors to monitor Tanzania's labor force. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Thailand made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government amended the Anti-Money Laundering Act to allow for assets seized from human trafficking offenders to be used as financial remedies for survivors of trafficking, including children who were sexually exploited. In addition, it established the Child Sexual Exploitation Crime Center to help facilitate investigations of offenses related to child pornographic materials. The government also established the Migrant Education Coordination Center to coordinate with Migrant Learning Centers on education, protection, and health of migrant children. Moreover, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports initiated the Child Friendly Tourism project by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with 21 government agencies, private sector organizations, and non-governmental organizations to develop measures to reduce commercial sexual exploitation of children in the tourism sector. Finally, the government drafted and approved the fifth National Policy and Plan to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2023–2027) in coordination with relevant public and private organizations across government and civil society. However, children in Thailand are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet the international standard for the minimum age for work because the law does not grant protections to children working outside of formal employment relationships. Moreover, there is a lack of available research and data on the prevalence of child labor in high-risk sectors, such as agriculture, garment manufacturing, domestic work, and construction.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Timor-Leste made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government increased funding for the labor inspectorate; established a child protection network; finalized, and trained law enforcement officials and service providers on, comprehensive, government-wide standard operating procedures for victim identification of human trafficking and referral, including for child victims of trafficking; and completed a quantitative labor survey. However, despite these new initiatives to address child labor, Timor-Leste is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that some school principals forced pregnant girls to leave school, making them more vulnerable to involvement in child labor, including its worst forms. Children in Timor-Leste are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in street vending and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Although Timor-Leste law provides for criminal penalties for the worst forms of child labor, labor inspection agencies are not empowered to inspect or enforce labor standards in the informal agriculture and commercial sectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Togo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Savanes Emergency Plan, which by strengthening education access and social welfare in the areas of the north affected by violent extremism, also addresses poverty, conflict, and lack of educational access as root causes of child labor. Meanwhile, the Safety Nets and Basic Services Project provided meals to school children in vulnerable communities and expanded unconditional cash transfers to 83,681 program participants. Furthermore, Togo eliminated fees for birth certificates, which may improve access to education and other social services. However, children in Togo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. The government has not devoted sufficient resources to allow the labor inspectorate to conduct inspections in all sectors and fully enforce the law. In addition, hazardous work regulations are insufficient because they allow children as young as 15 to perform some types of hazardous tasks, including carrying heavy loads. Finally, the government does not publish data related to its criminal enforcement efforts with regard to laws on the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Tokelau, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund to launch the Pacific Region Inclusive Education Review to ensure that all children, including those with disabilities, have access to quality education. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution; the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Tokelau has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

The government launched its Future-Ready Children program to expand remote learning opportunities for students and support the drafting of a child protection policy. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tonga is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that Tonga lacks a functioning labor inspectorate for the enforcement of labor laws and regulations. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Tonga are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in farming and fishing. There are no laws specifying a minimum age for work, defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, or prohibiting the use of children for the production and trafficking of drugs, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation. In addition, the government has not established a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Tunisia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In March 2022, the government adopted a guide for labor inspectors when they encounter child labor. It also launched a digital platform to improve coordination among agencies who respond to child abuse, including child labor, and opened two new schools to help students who had dropped out of school reintegrate back into education or job skills training. However, children in Tunisia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The budget for staffing and logistics, such as for fuel and transportation, is inadequate to carry out inspections, especially in remote areas of the country. In addition, the government was unable to provide complete data on its law enforcement efforts due to delays in the digitization of court records.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Tuvalu made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Advisory Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child worked on developing a child protection policy for schools. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Tuvalu engage in child labor in fishing and domestic work. The government has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Tuvalu lacks information on labor law and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Uganda made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The City of Kampala published an ordinance to prohibit the employment of children in hazardous work, including activities such as working in rock quarries and restaurants, collecting and selling scraps, and domestic work. The government also secured seven convictions for crimes related to child trafficking for labor purposes, approved a child labor inspection checklist, and released the results of a 2021 baseline survey on child labor in the rice and sugarcane growing areas in eastern Uganda. In addition, a National Child Focused Research Agenda (2022–2026) was launched, which enables evidence-based programing and includes research questions on child labor. However, children in Uganda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, Uganda's minimum age for hazardous work does not meet the international standard as the Employment of Children Regulations permit a commissioner to allow children ages 12 and older enrolled in an educational training or apprenticeship program to engage in hazardous work. Moreover, the law only guarantees free education through the primary level, even though international standards require free basic education through lower secondary school. In addition, the lack of a centralized supervisory authority, along with inadequate funding, training, and resources, hampered the capacity of law enforcement agencies to conduct child labor inspections and investigations.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Ukraine made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite the ongoing aggression and territorial incursions made by Russia against Ukraine, the Ukrainian government passed several pieces of legislation to address child welfare, including child labor. Ukraine established a coordination body to support the temporary domestic and international evacuation of Ukrainian children living in various government institutions in areas affected by Russia's full-scale invasion. In addition, the government shared counter-trafficking information with refugees and displaced persons at border crossings and on social media to prevent child trafficking. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Ukraine is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to uphold Law No. 877-V of 2007, which restricts inspectors' ability to conduct unannounced labor inspections and delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Children in Ukraine face increased social, economic, and political challenges, which can make them more vulnerable to exploitation because of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine launched on February 24, 2022. The increased vulnerability is most pronounced in the country’s Russia-occupied areas and areas of active conflict. Children in Ukraine are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of pornography. Children, especially in Russia-occupied areas, also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Furthermore, Russia continues to forcibly separate Ukrainian children from their parents and, in some cases, illegally transfer them out of Ukraine to camps in Russia. It is impossible to monitor these camps or ensure that the children in them are not exploited now or in the future if they are not returned to their families in Ukraine. The government has not published labor and criminal law enforcement information regarding its efforts to address child labor. In addition, Ukrainian laws do not meet international standards for the prohibition of commercialized sexual exploitation because they do not criminalize the users of prostitution involving children.      </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Uzbekistan made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In October 2022, the Uzbek president signed a new labor code that places additional restrictions on work that can be performed by children. The government also issued a decree to reduce informal work and worked with the International Labor Organization to conduct a comprehensive survey of working conditions in the construction sector. In addition, it continued to run public awareness campaigns against child labor which targeted high risk sectors. The National Commission on Combating Trafficking in Persons and Forced Labor also adopted action plans to implement U.S. government recommendations on child labor and trafficking in persons. However, children in Uzbekistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and public works. While the government has made strong progress in addressing labor issues in the cotton harvest, there continue to be impediments to the operation of non-governmental organizations in addressing broader labor concerns. Human rights and civil society organizations, including those working on forced and child labor issues, are frequently denied official registration for bureaucratic reasons, sometimes for failing to meet registration requirements that had not been publicly specified.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Vanuatu made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund to launch several child protection programs. This included establishing a free 24/7 child helpline to connect callers with trained child protection offices to report concerns. Additionally, the National Child Protection Referral Pathway guidance document was released, which outlined the roles for different stakeholders and service providers to support children, including psychosocial support. Lastly, the government streamlined the issuance of national identification cards for children. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Vanuatu are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in forestry and logging. Vanuatu’s minimum age for hazardous work, 15, is below the international standard of age 18. Vanuatu also lacks a referral mechanism between criminal authorities and social services providers.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Palestinian Authority made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the areas of the West Bank under its control. In 2022, the labor inspectorate detected 360 more violations of child labor laws than in 2021 and courts achieved 9 convictions for child labor crimes. However, children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction and fishing. The Palestinian Authority’s legal framework does not establish child trafficking or forced labor as a criminal offense in accordance with international standards. Labor investigators also reported that they cannot inspect worksites at night, when they suspect child labor occurs, because of insufficient funding for overtime. In addition, social programs to prevent or eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kingdom of Morocco claims the territory of Western Sahara and administers the area that it controls with the same constitution, laws, and structures as in internationally recognized Morocco, including laws that deal with child labor. During the reporting period, the Moroccan government drafted a national strategy against human trafficking and developed a guide to help government ministries identify trafficking victims. However, children in Western Sahara are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation. Additionally, the Labor Code's minimum age for work provisions do not meet international standards as children 15 years of age and under are not protected when working in traditional artisan and handicraft sectors. Furthermore, the scope of government social programs is insufficient as they do not fully address children exploited through domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Yemen made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2022, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor conducted four inspections based on complaints. However, despite this initiative, Yemen is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. There is evidence of recruitment and use of children in hostilities by state armed forces in contravention of Yemeni law. Furthermore, the government failed to make efforts to address discrimination in schools against children from the Muhamasheen (“marginalized”) community, leading to their increased vulnerability to child labor. Children in Yemen are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and use in armed conflict, including by Houthi insurgent forcesand other armed groups. Children also perform dangerous tasks in fishing. Research found no evidence of a government policy on worst forms of child labor outside of child soldiering. Moreover, the Republic of Yemen government continued to have limited operational control over its ministries and was unable to enforce regulations to address child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Zambia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government updated its Trafficking in Persons Act, removing the requirement that force, fraud, and other forms of coercion be demonstrated to establish a child trafficking crime, and launched the National Human Trafficking and Smuggling of Migrants and the National Migrant Policy, which include strategies to protect Zambian and migrant children from human trafficking and labor exploitation. In addition, the government recruited 30,000 new teachers, deploying them to rural areas where vulnerabilities to child labor are the highest.  However, children in Zambia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in agriculture. The Education Act does not specify a compulsory education age. In addition, labor inspectors do not routinely inspect non-registered businesses in which child labor is known to occur.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Zimbabwe made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created a new Child Labor Unit within the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare to steer the Ministry's child labor activities, and worked with NGOs to carry out research, coordination, and compliance investigations targeting the tea, tobacco, and other sectors where there is high prevalence of child labor. In addition, the government substantially expanded the Harmonized Social Cash Transfer Program and the Basic Education Assistance Module, which provide livelihood and educational assistance to families that have high vulnerability to child labor. However, Zimbabwe is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. State-aligned actors engaged in a pattern of threats and intimidation of worker organizations and trade unions, which are key stakeholders in the identification and prevention of child labor. Children in Zimbabwe are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in mines and on farms. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the harvesting of sugarcane and tobacco. Law enforcement agencies lack resources to enforce child labor laws.</Description>
