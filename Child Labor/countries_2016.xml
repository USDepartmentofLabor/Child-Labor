        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Afghanistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Afghanistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because government officials, particularly officers of the Afghan Local Police and Afghan National Police, were complicit in the use of commercial sexual exploitation of boys through the practice of bacha bazi, a practice that remains widespread throughout the country. The government failed to prosecute any government officials in bacha bazi cases in 2019, but convicted two civilians and indicted at least four others. During the reporting period, media reported allegations by human rights activists that at least 165 boys were sexually exploited at three public high schools in Logar Province, with the perpetrators video recording some of the acts for blackmail purposes. The activists’ research found evidence of involvement of dozens of educators, including teachers and principals. At the end of 2019, government investigators reported that while they uncovered evidence of child sexual assault in Logar, they had found no link between the abuse and educators in the Logar public school system. Two human rights activists who exposed the Logar network, however, were detained by the National Directorate of Security, physically mistreated, and subsequently fled the country with their families after receiving death threats. Although the government failed to prosecute Afghan Local Police or Afghan National Police officers implicated in bacha bazi crimes, it took a number of steps to combat bacha bazi and other forms of child labor and child trafficking, including establishing a National Child Protection Commission. However, children in Afghanistan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict and forced labor in the production of bricks and carpets, each sometimes the result of human trafficking. Afghanistan’s labor inspectorate is not authorized to impose penalties for child labor violations, and the government lacks sufficient programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Afghan law does not sufficiently criminalize forced labor, debt bondage, or commercial sexual exploitation of girls.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Albania made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Council for the Rights and Protection of the Child approved Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 704, which provides guidance to institutions responsible for identifying children working in violation of the law and referring cases to social protection services, and enacted the National Action Plan for the Protection of Children from Economic Exploitation, including those in street situations, 2019-2021. Furthermore, the General Prosecutor ordered the creation of the Development Center of Criminal Justice for Minors, which employs four part-time prosecutors and one judicial police officer to oversee cases related to the Justice Criminal Code for Minors. However, children in Albania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and mining, including of chromium. Children also engage in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The law does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities. In addition, the labor inspectorate needs to be strengthened so it can conduct inspections in all sectors in which child labor is known to occur.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Algeria made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government trained criminal law enforcement officers of the Directorate General for National Security and the National Gendarmerie, and provided specialized training to the Brigades for the Protection of Minors on issues of child labor. The National Authority for the Protection and Promotion of Children also trained judges on the protection of children during judicial proceedings and members of the Algerian media on the protection and promotion of children's rights. In addition, the government led child labor awareness-raising efforts on national television and online. However, children in Algeria engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street vending and begging. The government has not sufficiently prohibited the use of children in illicit activities or determined by national law or regulation the types of work that are hazardous for children to perform. Furthermore, the government lacks a sufficient number of labor inspectors to ensure that child labor laws are enforced in all geographic areas.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Angola made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the Law on Trafficking Victims Protection, which provides comprehensive protections for human trafficking victims, including specific measures for the protection of children. In addition, the government convicted 15 individuals of child trafficking crimes, and the Ministry of Social Action, Family, and the Promotion of Women conducted several national awareness-raising campaigns regarding the worst forms of child labor. The government also approved its first National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Persons, and began opening registry offices in maternity wards throughout all 18 provinces to facilitate birth registrations. However, children in Angola engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. Although Angola made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions against the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards because they do not prohibit the procuring or offering of a child for the production of pornography or the use, procuring, or offering of a child for pornographic performances. In addition, there are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce, and social programs do not target all sectors in which children work. </Description>

The law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum ages for work and hazardous work do not meet international standards and Anguilla lacks a list of prohibited hazardous occupations and activities for children. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Argentina made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government issued two regulations to strengthen inspection procedures with respect to child labor and unauthorized adolescent work. Argentine courts continued to render indictments and convictions for child sexual exploitation and child trafficking cases, and the Special Prosecutor's Office for Human Trafficking and Exploitation provided training to prosecutors, defenders, judicial officials, and university students. The Superintendent of Labor Risks also collaborated with the International Labor Organization and youth advocacy groups to adopt a new National Action Plan to Improve the Safety and Health at Work of Adolescents and Youth. In addition, the former Secretariat of Labor, Employment, and Social Security, which now has the title of Ministry, partnered with the Tucuman Ministry of Production, civil society, and the private sector to develop an agricultural child labor monitoring system, which is being piloted in blueberry and yerba mate plantations in Tucuman and Misiones. However, children in Argentina engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, including the sale and distribution of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Moreover, the government does not publish complete information about its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Armenia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Article 33 of the Labor Code was amended to fully authorize the Health and Labor Inspection Body to enforce labor laws, including those related to child labor, beginning in July 2021. Article 33 will empower the Health and Labor Inspection Body to issue penalties for violations and conduct inspections in sectors for which inspection checklists have been approved. In addition, that agency conducted activities to raise awareness about child labor laws. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Armenia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Armenia has lacked a functioning labor inspectorate since the 2014 repeal of Article 34 of the Labor Code, which previously established the government's authority to implement labor legislation and collective agreements. Since that time, the government has lacked a mechanism to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws, including a mechanism with the authority to conduct unannounced inspections. The Health and Labor Inspection Body will not be empowered to perform these functions until its new mandate under Article 33 of the Labor Code enters into force in 2021. Children in Armenia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. The government also established a new National Commission on Combating Trafficking in Persons and Forced Labor and adopted a new roadmap to combat trafficking in persons and forced labor. In addition, no government programs exist to aid children engaged in child labor in agriculture.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Azerbaijan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented a number of measures to improve access to education for disabled students, including upgrading school infrastructure, raising awareness for parents on inclusive services, and training school directors and teachers in inclusive methods. In addition, the government conducted research on child labor in three cities and five districts. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In 2017, the government extended a moratorium on labor inspections, including worksite inspections, until 2021. While inspectors can respond to complaints, the lack of proactive or onsite inspection mechanisms may leave potential violations of child labor laws undetected in workplaces. Children in Azerbaijan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Legal protections only apply to workers with written employment contracts, leaving self-employed children and children working outside of formal employment relationships vulnerable to exploitation. Furthermore, coordinating bodies, including the State Committee on Family, Women, and Children's Affairs, lack the capacity and clear legal authority to effectively carry out their mandates. In addition, government programs to address child labor in agriculture may be insufficient to address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Bangladesh made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government acceded to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and, through its programs in 2019, removed over 1,000 working children from 558 factories, provided education for 1,254 street children, and rehabilitated 3,501 children. Since 2017, government programs have removed 90,000 children from hazardous labor conditions, and over 35,000 children from exploitative work. Within 15 ministries responsible for children in some way, the government of Bangladesh increased its spending on children by 17 percent between the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 fiscal years. However, children in Bangladesh engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced child labor in the production of dried fish and bricks. Children also perform dangerous tasks in garment and leather goods supply chains. Moreover, the Bangladesh Labor Act does not apply to the informal sector, where most child labor in Bangladesh occurs, and hazardous work prohibitions are not comprehensive. Additionally, labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties and, when courts do impose them, the fines are too low to deter child labor law violations. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Belize made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a Child Labor Secretariat and Inspectorate to identify, coordinate, and report on child labor cases, and created a program to conduct targeted child labor inspections. During the reporting period, the National Child Labor Committee met regularly and began updating their 2009 National Child Labor Policy by adding additional protections for children. The government also continued to fund a cash assistance program to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of children. However, children in Belize engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and construction. The country's minimum age for work is 12 and does not meet international standards. In addition, the country lacks prohibitions against the use of children in illicit activities and does not appear to have programs to address child labor in agriculture, except in the sugar industry.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Benin made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Departments of Atlantique and Zou issued decrees prohibiting minors from going to bars and brothels in an attempt to eliminate the use of child labor in those establishments. In addition, Benin hired nearly 50 percent more labor inspectors than it had last year. However, children in Benin engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of cotton and crushed granite, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work and street vending. There are many barriers to education access, especially for children with disabilities. In addition, the government did not publicly release information on some of its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts and limited resources for the adequate enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Bhutan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government charged one defendant with child trafficking for the purpose of forced labor and adopted the Standard Operating Procedure for Multi-Sectoral Response to Address Trafficking in Persons in Bhutan, which defines the roles and responsibilities of each government agency in preventing and responding to trafficking in persons. In addition, the government hired 11 additional labor inspectors. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Bhutan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Bhutan’s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards and education is not compulsory. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Bolivia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Justice trained judges and prosecuting attorneys on conducting trials in cases of human trafficking. In addition, the government carried out anti- human trafficking awareness campaigns to educate students throughout the country, and the Ombudsman's Office published an evaluation of its efforts to prevent trafficking of children and adolescents, identifying key areas for improvement. However, children in Bolivia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of sugarcane. Although Bolivian law requires that apprentices attend school, it does not set a minimum age for participation in apprenticeships. In addition, Article 1 of Supreme Decree No. 1875 sets the minimum age for compulsory military service at 17 years, which does not comply with international standards. During the reporting period, political crisis and the implementation of a transitional government may have affected efforts to eradicate the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Bosnia and Herzegovina made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Council of Ministers adopted the 2020-2023 National Strategy to Combat Trafficking in Persons and improved victim access to social services by merging resources for domestic and foreign victims of human trafficking into one fund. The government also launched a project with the Council of Europe to prevent and combat human trafficking. However, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, the Anti-Trafficking Strike Force lacks coordination between prosecutors, police, and other relevant government stakeholders, and border police officers and social workers failed to properly identify unaccompanied migrant and refugee children as potential victims of human trafficking due to lack of proper protocols. Furthermore, laws on the minimum age for work do not meet international standards because they do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside of formal employment relationships.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Botswana made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government conducted trainings related to countering trafficking in persons and exploitation of children. However, children in Botswana engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, cattle herding, and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Key gaps remain in the country’s legal framework, including the lack of a minimum age for compulsory education and insufficient prohibitions for hazardous work. In addition, social programs do not always reach intended child labor victims, especially those engaged in cattle herding and domestic work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Brazil made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published two updated versions of the national “Dirty List” containing information on employers that the Ministry of Economy has found to be using slave labor, including that of children. The Labor Prosecution Service and the Federal Police also signed a 3-year technical cooperation agreement to combat child labor and forced labor, with the aim of increasing both agencies' technical capacity, while also providing access to each other's databases for more efficient information exchange. In addition, national, state, and local governments conducted a wide range of awareness-raising campaigns throughout the year, including a national meeting on combating child labor during which participants collaborated on a coordinating agenda to better promote education and combat child labor. Moreover, the Labor Prosecutor’s Office and the Labor Inspection Unit at the Ministry of Economy promoted the Fourth National Apprenticeship Week, a program that has significantly contributed in reducing child labor in the country, and the Ministry of Social Development in Pernambuco State assisted 8,932 victims of child labor. However, children in Brazil engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Although Brazil made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions against child trafficking for forced labor exploitation require the use of threats, violence, coercion, fraud, or abuse to be established for the crime of child trafficking and, therefore, do not meet international labor standards. In addition, there are likely not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce, and local governments lack the capacity to fully implement and monitor the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor, the family stipend program Bolsa Família, and other social protection programs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Burkina Faso made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a National Strategy to End the Worst Forms of Child Labor and a National Strategy for Children Protection. However, children in Burkina Faso engage in the worst forms of child labor,  including farming and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cotton harvesting. The Labor Code does not identify the activities in which children may engage in light work. The government also did not release information on its criminal and labor enforcement efforts and lacked resources for the enforcement of child labor laws.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement. During the reporting period, the government enacted the Child Rights Law and established the National Committee for the Rights of the Child to institute the policies, guidelines, and measures needed to implement the law. It also ratified the United Nation’s Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and, in April 2019, released the results of the Labor Force Survey. Furthermore, the recruitment of children into the national armed forces for use in armed conflict declined markedly in 2019; due to positive steps taken by the government to work towards fully eliminating the recruitment of children into the national military. In June 2020, the United Nations delisted the national military for the violation of use and recruitment of child soldiers from Annex 1 of the annual Secretary General’s Report on Children and Armed Conflict. Despite these commendable efforts, however, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement because the national armed forces continued to force civilians, including at least 197 children, to work as porters, cleaners, cooks, and agricultural laborers in the conflict areas of Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan states during the reporting period, and made no known efforts to hold criminally accountable those military personnel involved in these practices. Children in Burma engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced recruitment and use in armed conflict by non-state armed groups and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The vulnerability of Rohingya children to the worst forms of child labor also increased as many were denied access to education through government restrictions on their movement. Penalties for recruitment and use of children by the military or for the military’s use of civilian populations for forced labor are not sufficient for the seriousness of the crime, and the government did not publish information on criminal law enforcement efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict cases involving the worst forms of child labor. Although the government provided anecdotal information on criminal law enforcement efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict cases involving child labor through Facebook and the national media in 2019, it did not regularly publish comprehensive statistics on its efforts to address such crimes.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Burundi made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government worked on revisions to its Labor Code to align with international standards on child labor and launched a partnership with the International Organization for Migration to improve coordination between government ministries, the National Police, and civil society organizations to address human trafficking. It also published labor inspection funding data for the first time, conducted inspections in all provinces, and continued to fund the Centers for Family Development, which provide reintegration services for victims. However, children in Burundi engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Burundi lacks a compulsory education age that is equal to the minimum age for work and the government failed to provide comprehensive criminal law enforcement data related to the worst forms of child labor. Other challenges remain, including a lack of resources to conduct labor inspections and criminal investigations; a lack of well-trained educators, and infrastructure in the education sector; and insufficient social programs to address child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Cabo Verde made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased the number of labor inspectors by 50 percent, and implemented a Child Protection Information and Case Management System, which aims to identify and track victims of the worst forms of child labor, including child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the Cabo Verdean Institute for Children and Adolescents, in collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund, drafted a Child Protection Policy. However, children in Cabo Verde engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. Law enforcement officials lack the necessary resources to follow up on investigations, and communication among enforcement agencies is still limited. In addition, social programs to assist children involved in agriculture and domestic work are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Cambodia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government, in conjunction with the ILO, conducted its first nationwide survey of child labor since 2012, with data scheduled for release in 2020. In addition, the government signed an agreement expanding funding to allow the International Labor Organization's Better Factories Cambodia program to extend its monitoring mandate to additional sectors, including to formal subcontracting factories where child labor is found. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Cambodia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because the government failed to take active measures to investigate, prosecute, convict, and sentence public officials who participate in or facilitate the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation of children and debt-based forced labor in brick kilns. In addition, during the reporting period, judges were allegedly reported to have accepted bribes in return for dismissal of charges, acquittal, and reduced sentencing for individuals committing such crimes, especially for those with alleged ties to the government; this made children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Cambodia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in brickmaking and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Insufficient resources may hamper the labor inspectorate's capacity to enforce child labor laws, especially in rural areas where the majority of child laborers work. In addition, continuing challenges in accessing basic education and the absence of a compulsory education requirement increase children's vulnerability to involvement in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Cameroon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government supported a new 6 year project to address child labor in the production of cocoa and continued to support programs that provide services to vulnerable street children. In addition, unlike in previous years, the government published information on labor inspectorate funding. However, children in Cameroon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cocoa production. The government has not acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. In addition, it has not prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs. Furthermore, the law does not criminally prohibit the recruitment of children under age 18 by non-state armed groups.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, the Central African Republic made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Under a 2019 peace agreement, the government and non-state armed groups committed to ending and preventing grave violations against children, including the recruitment of child soldiers. Several parties signed Action Plans to implement these commitments, and 1,150 children were demobilized during the reporting period. The National Assembly also adopted an expansive new child protection code, and the government established the National Inter-Ministerial Committee to Combat Human Trafficking. However, children in the Central African Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict by non-state armed groups and in diamond mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Additionally, the Central African Republic does not meet the international standard for minimum age protections since it does not include children working in the informal sector. Moreover, an estimated 1.3 million children lacked access to education because of ongoing instability, and limited resources hampered the government’s implementation of policies and programs to address child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Chad made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Justice adopted a national road map to implement a 2018 trafficking in persons law, and the Ministry of National Education unveiled a 2 year education program to support up to 230,000 vulnerable children. Chad's Child Protection Brigade also added a hub office in Lai and trained 100 focal points responsible for coordinating investigations with regional offices. However, children in Chad engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in cattle herding and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Additionally, the government does not collect data on law enforcement efforts and has no active policies to address child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Chile made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Prosecutor's Office signed a cooperative agreement with the Ombudsman's Office for the Rights of Children to improve coordination in providing services to children in need, and the Undersecretary of Labor created the Child Labor Eradication Department to ensure Chile's compliance with international treaties that protect the rights of children and adolescents. In addition, the government passed legislation to regulate the participation of children and adolescents in criminal testimony, including cases of human trafficking, to avoid re-traumatizing victims. It also developed an updated Anti-Trafficking National Action Plan for the 2019–2022 period and continued to fund a number of social programs to address child labor. However, children in Chile engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, existing prohibitions related to forced labor do not meet international standards because forced labor is criminally prohibited only when it results from human trafficking. In addition, prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available enforcement data, including the labor inspectorate funding and number of labor inspectors.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists on Christmas Island, in 2019 the government made a moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Australia enacted the Modern Slavery Act, which applies to Christmas Island, and took steps to begin consultations on a revised National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery. Although Christmas Island made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws related to child trafficking do not meet international standards because the recruitment, harboring, transfer, and receipt of children for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation are not prohibited. In addition, as the minimum age for work is lower than the compulsory education age, children may be encouraged to leave school before the completion of compulsory education.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Colombia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor launched a virtual training campus for labor inspectors, including a Fundamental Rights at Work course with modules on child labor, and trained local officials on its Comprehensive Child Labor Information System. In an effort to address the education and health of the increased Venezuelan refugee population, the government passed Law 1997 that granted birthright citizenship to children born in Colombia to Venezuelan parents during the period January 1, 2015 - September 16, 2021. The Ministry of the Interior also collaborated with civil society organizations to evaluate the government's anti-trafficking in persons strategy. In addition, the government expanded the Eyes Everywhere anti-commercial sexual exploitation campaign. However, children in Colombia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, the government does not employ a sufficient number of labor inspectors.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Comoros made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Assembly passed legislation authorizing the president to ratify the Palermo Protocol, which the president did in January 2020. Comoros also created the National Commission for Solidarity, Social Protection, and the Promotion of Gender to improve cooperation with state and non-state actors involved in child protection. In addition, services for child victims of violence were expanded with the opening of a new center under the Services d'Ecoute (Listening and Counseling Services) program. However, children in Comoros engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. Furthermore, labor and criminal investigators lack the resources and funds necessary to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor, and Comoros lacks national action plans to combat child labor and trafficking in persons. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made no advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted a new anti-trafficking in persons law, established a national anti-trafficking coordinating body, and finalized a five-year national strategy to combat human trafficking. A military court also sentenced a former colonel to life imprisonment for the unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers. Moreover, the government implemented a new universal primary education decree, expanding funding for public schools and significantly reducing the number of children vulnerable to labor exploitation.  However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is receiving an assessment of no advancement because of the national army's complicity in the worst forms of child labor. During the year, an Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) regiment supplied weapons and munitions to and allowed the free movement of a proxy non-state armed group known for recruiting children, enabling the armed group to expand its control over mineral-rich sites in the east. In addition, a FARDC regiment in Tshikapa forcibly abducted young girls into sexual slavery. The FARDC also illegally detained children for alleged association with armed groups and failed to hold some of its units accountable for perpetrating the worst forms of child labor. Moreover, regiment commanders and their superiors actively interfered with investigations into forced child recruitment and the sexual exploitation of children allegedly perpetrated by their forces. Children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, tin ore (cassiterite), tantalum ore (coltan), and tungsten ore (wolframite), and are used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups. Other gaps remain, including a lack of trained enforcement personnel, limited financial resources, and poor coordination of government efforts to combat child labor. Research also indicates that labor inspectors failed to conduct any worksite inspections for the fourth year in a row. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, the Republic of the Congo made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved comprehensive legislation making all forms of trafficking in persons illegal and worked with neighboring countries to implement bilateral anti-trafficking measures. The labor inspectorate also added 241 labor inspectors to its payroll. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are involved in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government has yet to accede to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, and existing programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor in all relevant sectors. In addition, information on children's work is extremely limited because there has never been a national child labor survey or similar research conducted in the Republic of the Congo.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Cook Islands, in 2019, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Cook Islands increased its labor inspectorate budget. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Costa Rica made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published data from the 2018 National Household Survey, which includes information on the prevalence of child labor in Costa Rica. In collaboration with the International Labor Organization, the Ministry of Labor began implementing the Risk Module for Identifying Child Labor, which assists government officials in targeting communities at greater risk of employing child labor. In addition, prosecutors obtained sentences for three individuals on charges pertaining to the commercial sexual exploitation of children, and the government passed new laws on trafficking in persons, including one that increased the statute of limitations for victims. The government also adopted a new 4-year National Plan for Development that includes strategies for addressing child labor. However, children in Costa Rica engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Furthermore, existing social programs are not accessible to workers in all sectors and the labor inspectorate lacks the authority to assess penalties for labor violations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Côte d’Ivoire made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government initiated 143 prosecutions related to the worst forms of child labor, and the Ministry of Justice issued a circular instructing law enforcement officials and the judiciary to fine, arrest, or prosecute perpetrators of child labor. In addition, the government officially adopted the National Action Plan for the Fight Against Trafficking, Exploitation, and Child Labor, which was developed in 2018. However, children in Côte d’Ivoire engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. A lack of financial resources and personnel may have hindered labor law enforcement efforts. In addition, labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Djibouti made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor quadrupled the size of its labor inspectorate, and Djibouti's Police Chief created a new Brigade for Minors. The government also enrolled 5,003 refugee children in education centers in Djibouti City and rural areas in collaboration with UNICEF. However, children in Djibouti engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Minimum age provisions only apply to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards. Law enforcement efforts are inadequate to prevent and combat child labor, in part because labor inspectors lack the authority to assess penalties. In addition, the government did not make adequate efforts to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor due to lack of financial and human resource allocation and reporting mechanisms.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Dominica made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2018, Dominica launched a Climate Resilience Agency and enacted the Climate Resilience Act, which facilitated in 2019 the rebuilding and reopening of all schools that had been damaged by the 2017 hurricane. Although research found no evidence that child labor, including its worst forms, exists in Dominica, no recent study of child labor has been done to confirm this. Dominica's legal framework does not protect children from exploitative work outside of the school year, and the government has not determined the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. The country also lacks prohibitions against the use of children in pornography, or pornographic performances, and the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, the Dominican Republic made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor significantly increased the number of labor inspectors from 148 inspectors in 2018 to 205 inspectors in 2019. The Progressing with Solidarity program also supported over 300,000 households with school-aged children and the government expanded the Extended School Day program which covered over 75 percent of the nation’s schoolchildren as of December 2019. However, children in the Dominican Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain, including limited human and financial resources for the enforcement of child labor laws, especially with regards to preventing children from engaging in harmful work in the agricultural sector and commercial sexual exploitation. Labor inspectors also lack the authority to assess penalties for violations related to child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Ecuador made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. To improve coordination between ministries, the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion implemented an inter-agency agreement on joint inspections and the government put into effect the Inter-Institutional Action Protocol for the Comprehensive Care and Protection of Victims of Trafficking in Persons. The Ministry of Labor also upgraded its Unified System of Registration of Child Labor to make it easier to report cases and the government adopted the National Action Plan Against Trafficking in Persons. In addition, the government published the results of a study that included information on child labor and launched the Palma Futuro project to combat child labor and forced labor in the palm oil sector. However, children in Ecuador engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. The labor inspectorate continues to lack sufficient resources and children continue to face barriers to education, especially in rural areas.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Egypt made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government formed and held the inaugural meeting of the National Steering Committee for the National Action Plan to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor and Supporting Families, which will coordinate the implementation of the plan. The National Council for Childhood and Motherhood also continued to strengthen Child Protection Committees that had been inactive. Additionally, the Ministry of Social Solidarity exceeded its yearly goal in providing supplemental income to families to support children's school attendance, reaching 5 million children by April 2019. However, children in Egypt engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in quarrying limestone. Additionally, the government did not publish data on the enforcement of child labor laws and programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, El Salvador made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published results from its Annual Multipurpose Household Survey, which identifies child labor prevalence in the country. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare also significantly increased fines assessed for labor violations and criminal law enforcement agencies investigated 45 cases of child commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the National Council for Children established an emergency hotline to receive reports of child abuse, including child labor. However, children in El Salvador engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and in illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of coffee. Law enforcement agencies continued to lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws throughout the country. Gaps also remained related to the implementation of key policies to address child labor.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement because it had a policy of being complicit in the use of forced child labor in more than isolated incidents. Government officials continued to force students in grade 12, some of whom are under the age of 18, to participate in military training elements of the government's compulsory national service program. Otherwise, the government made efforts by acceding to ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and, for the first time, providing data on sectors targeted for inspection and the number of labor inspectors on its payroll. Children in Eritrea engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced military training associated with national service and forced agricultural labor. The government also has not issued a list identifying hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children. In addition, the government does not have a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Eswatini made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a program with IOM to Strengthen the Coordination Mechanism to Respond to Trafficking in Persons and Ensure Justice and Protection for all Victims of Trafficking in Eswatini. The government also approved and formally launched a new Trafficking in Persons National Strategic Framework and Action Plan. In addition, the government sentenced one individual to 15 years in prison for subjecting a 16 year old to forced labor and arrested a senior government official for the sex trafficking of a minor. However, children in Eswatini engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and herding livestock. Significant gaps in the legal framework remain, including a lack of legislation regulating the labor conditions under Kuhlehla and other customary practices, and a de facto compulsory education age that does not meet international standards. In addition, minimum age protections do not extend to children engaged in domestic work and agriculture, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age to work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Ethiopia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government issued a new Labor Proclamation, raising the minimum age for work from 14 to 15 years, and approved the Organizations of Civil Societies Proclamation, replacing a 2009 law that limited the operations of organizations working on child and forced labor issues in Ethiopia. With external support, the government also launched the Effective Approaches in Ending the Worst Forms of Child Labor program to test and measure innovative approaches to address the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Ethiopia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation. The law in Ethiopia does not include free basic education or a compulsory age for education, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor have also not sufficiently targeted sectors with high incidences of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Falkland Islands, in 2019 the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Safeguarding Children’s Board convened multiple times to discuss issues related to the safety and wellbeing of children. However, the minimum ages for work and for hazardous work do not meet international standards, and the law does not prohibit adults from using, procuring, and offering a child for the production and trafficking of drugs. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Fiji made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government successfully prosecuted a case of domestic child trafficking, resulting in the first conviction of its kind since 2014. The Fiji police also formalized its Human Trafficking Unit and hired seven dedicated officers. In addition, the Ministry of Employment, Productivity, and Industrial Relations allocated $160,000 to combat child labor, particularly in the sugarcane industry. However, children in Fiji engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. In addition, there are no criminal prohibitions against the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups. </Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Gabon made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government convicted two individuals of child trafficking and successfully extradited from the Republic of Congo a prominent businessman and parliamentarian accused of trafficking children for commercial sexual exploitation. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Gabon is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a regression in practice that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to provide evidence it conducted worksite inspections during the reporting period. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Gabon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. Gabonese law lacks prohibitions against the use of children in illicit activities and the minimum age for work provisions only apply to children in formal employment relationships, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age for work. In addition, labor inspectors do not have the authority to assess penalties, and they lack the basic resources necessary to conduct investigations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, The Gambia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting year, the government signed the UN CRC Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict. The Government of the Gambia also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of the United Arab Emirates to put in place formal protections for Gambian workers employed in the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons held trainings, some in conjunction with local and international partners, for government officials at border posts, school-aged children, The Gambia Police, travel agencies, airlines, and the Tourism Security Unit, on trafficking in persons issues. However, children in The Gambia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Gaps in the law remain, including that children may commence an apprenticeship in the informal sector at the age of 12, an age below the compulsory education age of 16. Although the government has adopted various policies addressing human trafficking, research found no evidence of a policy on other worst forms of child labor. In addition, the scope of social programs is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem, as programs do not reach all children working in agriculture and domestic work, or those vulnerable to human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, and street work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Georgia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed and implemented the 2019 Law on Occupational Safety, which grants labor inspectors the ability to enter any business for occupational health and safety reasons without prior notification. In addition, law enforcement agencies increased their efforts to combat child begging by investigating, prosecuting, and convicting individuals who force children to beg and providing services to child victims of forced begging. However, children in Georgia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The labor inspectorate did not conduct inspections in the agriculture sector, and the labor law governing the minimum age for work is not in compliance with international standards because it does not apply to informal work. In addition, the compulsory education age leaves children who are 15 years of age vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor, as they are not required to be in school but are not legally permitted to work full time.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Ghana made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government committed to use the Trafficking in Persons Information System developed by the International Organization for Migration to improve case tracking and inter-ministerial coordinated responses. However, children in Ghana continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in fishing and cocoa harvesting, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Prohibitions related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards as the use of children in pornographic performances is not criminally prohibited, and the law also does not prohibit the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Additionally, the government has not acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and resource constraints severely limited the government's abilities to adequately enforce labor laws and implement social programs during the reporting period.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Grenada made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Grenada, no study of child labor has been done to confirm this. The government's ability to prevent children from becoming engaged in the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition, there is no explicit prohibition against children’s involvement in hazardous work and illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Guatemala made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government introduced new protections for adolescent workers to ensure that they do not participate in the worst forms of child labor. Guatemala also adopted the new Model for Comprehensive Care for Children and Adolescents, a multi-agency mechanism designed to provide care for child trafficking victims. In addition, government agencies began implementing the Child Labor Risk Identification Model, which is designed to identify child labor vulnerabilities and develop strategies in response. Furthermore, Guatemala developed a monitoring and evaluation tool in anticipation of a new national action plan to combat child labor and launched the next phase of its Blue Heart campaign to raise awareness about human trafficking. However, children in Guatemala are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, such as in the production of coffee. The lack of a sufficient number of labor inspectors and resources limited the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare's ability to combat the worst forms of child labor. In addition, existing social programs are insufficient to reach all children engaged in exploitative labor and, in particular, do not target children engaged in domestic work or agriculture.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Guinea made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Assembly adopted a revised Child Code that must be enacted by the President, which includes a more specific list of hazardous child labor activities and more severe penalties for violations related to child labor. However, children in Guinea engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. The government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. Laws related to the minimum age for work do not meet international standards because they do not include children working outside of a formal employment relationship and children who are self-employed. In addition, the government does not implement sufficient social programs to address the extent of the child labor problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Guinea-Bissau made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Institute for Women and Children and the National Guard for Migration Services conducted human trafficking trainings for law enforcement officials, including on a national referral mechanism, assistance to victims, and data management. The government also approved the National Action Plan to Eliminate and Combat Trafficking in Persons, which aims to strengthen legislation and promote coordination among relevant government agencies. However, children in Guinea-Bissau engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. In addition, the minimum age for work is not in compliance with international standards, because the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children without a work contract. Law enforcement officials do not receive sufficient training and resources to adequately conduct inspections and prosecute cases of child labor, and social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Guyana made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted and began implementation of the National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor and launched an updated Inter-Ministerial Task Force on Combating Trafficking in Persons National Plan of Action, which establishes mechanisms to address human trafficking, including child trafficking. In addition, the government drafted a revised Combating Trafficking in Persons Bill, which would increase the legislative protection for victims, including children. However, children in Guyana are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Law enforcement agencies have insufficient financial and human resources to enforce laws related to child labor, including its worst forms, and existing laws do not fully prohibit using children in certain forms of child labor. Moreover, the government does not have targeted social programs to fully address the extent of the child labor problem in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Haiti made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the National Tripartite Commission for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor made updates to the draft hazardous work list and draft National Action Plan to Combat Child Labor. However, children in Haiti perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and domestic work. Children are placed in orphanages where some are subsequently used for domestic work. Minimum age protections apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards requiring all children to be protected. In addition, Haiti lacks a clear, easily applicable minimum age for domestic work and a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. Also, labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Honduras made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established reciprocal referral mechanisms to ensure child laborers and victims of child-related crimes receive access to social services. It also began implementing its new National Labor Inspection Strategy, which includes monitoring and evaluation of child labor-specific inspections and identifies child labor as an enforcement priority. Furthermore, government agencies coordinated to conduct multiple joint operations targeting child labor in San Pedro Sula and Cortes. However, children in Honduras engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and use in illicit activities, including selling and trafficking drugs. Children also engage in child labor in the production of coffee and melons. Labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lacked financial and human resources and the government did not adequately report comprehensive data related to its criminal law enforcement efforts. In addition, the government’s social programs that address child labor in agriculture have not addressed the problem nationwide, and the government lacks social programs to eliminate child labor in other sectors, including fishing, mining, and domestic work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, India made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government began digitizing the records of shelter homes throughout the country; shut down 539 illegal shelter homes in Maharashtra, Jharkand, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh; and convicted a Bihar shelter owner and 18 others of sex trafficking 44 girls from a shelter. In addition, the National Child Labor Project Scheme rescued from child labor and rehabilitated 66,169 children in 2018–2019, up from 47,635 during 2017–2018. The government enacted the Protection Of Children From Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act, which includes new penalties for perpetrators of the worst forms of child labor, and approved a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Burma on enhancing bilateral cooperation for the prevention of trafficking in persons. Furthermore, the Tamil Nadu State Government issued standard operating procedures to support efforts to eradicate the bonded labor system in the state by 2021. However, children in India engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor producing garments and quarrying stones. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of thread and yarn. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, 1,300 of India's approximately 9,000 government-run, government-funded shelters that house children continued to lack official registration from the government, allowing them to operate with little or no oversight and putting children at risk for exploitation, including commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, despite the identification of grievous abuses – including child trafficking of residents – found in over 100 government-funded and/or government-run shelters in Bihar state in 2018 and additional instances identified in other states in 2019, the government only prosecuted and convicted individuals in one of these cases in 2019. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work for long periods of time in unsafe and unhealthy environments, and penalties for employing children are insufficient to deter violations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Indonesia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published the Indonesian Children Profile report, which provides the most recent government source of publicly available child labor data. The government also substantially increased its labor inspectorate funding from $10.2 million in 2018 to $16.7 million in 2019, with specific funds allocated to enforcing child labor regulations. In addition, the Indonesian National Police investigated cases of child trafficking involving 28 child victims. However, children in Indonesia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in plantation agriculture, including in palm oil and tobacco production. The Ministry of Manpower continued to lack the financial resources and personnel necessary to fully enforce child labor laws throughout the country. In addition, the government did not publish criminal enforcement information on the number of investigations conducted, violations found, prosecutions initiated, and convictions for crimes relating to the worst forms of child labor.  </Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Iraq made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kurdistan Regional Government established an Inter-ministerial Committee on Trafficking in Persons to oversee implementation of its Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law. However, Iraq is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government authorities continued to inappropriately detain and prosecute without legal representation children allegedly affiliated with ISIS—some of whom were victims of forcible recruitment and use—including using abusive interrogation techniques and torture to gain children’s confessions instead of screening these children as potential victims of the worst forms of child labor. In addition, NGOs reported that in 2019, some militia groups affiliated with the Popular Mobilization Forces, including Iranian-backed groups, recruited boys younger than age 18 to fight in Syria and Yemen. While these forces operated under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces—which was legally incorporated into the Iraqi defense forces in 2016—they generally remained outside of the command and control of the Iraqi government.  Children in Iraq engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and in commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government did not provide information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. The government also continues to lack programs that focus on assisting children involved in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Jamaica made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved an updated National Plan of Action to Combat Human Trafficking and conducted a 4-day training workshop on human trafficking. It also significantly expanded the budget for the Program for Advancement through Health and Education, from $35 million in 2018 to $70.7 million in 2019. However, children in Jamaica engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and illicit activities. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and street work. Although the government has laws prohibiting the use of children in some illicit activities, it does not provide higher penalties for using, procuring, or offering children for the production and distribution of drugs compared to those for using adults. In addition, Jamaica's labor inspectorate lacks the authority to assess penalties for labor law violations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Jordan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor’s Child Labor Unit established and began using an electronic child labor monitoring system to coordinate government and civil society efforts to remove children from child labor and provide them with services. Moreover, the government increased the number of families receiving assistance through the National Aid Fund, a program that provides cash transfers conditioned on families re-enrolling working children in school. In addition, the government continued to provide shelter, educational, and financial services to children engaged in child labor. However, children in Jordan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in street work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Insufficient resources hampered the Ministry of Labor’s capacity to ensure compliance with child labor laws in the agricultural sector. Moreover, and despite government efforts, Syrian children still face barriers to accessing education due to socioeconomic pressures, bullying, and costs associated with transportation and supplies, among other issues. In addition, the government did not conduct investigations on cases related to the worst forms of child labor, including forced begging or commercial sexual exploitation of children, even though there is evidence of these worst forms of child labor. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Kazakhstan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, in cooperation with other government agencies, carried out targeted joint inspection operations in areas where child labor may occur, and the government adopted a new national action plan on elimination of the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Kazakhstan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in markets. The government lacks current, comprehensive, and detailed research on child labor, including in cotton production. Labor inspectors also have limited authority to conduct routine inspections. In addition, the government did not carry out social programs to assist children engaged in all relevant forms of child labor in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Kenya made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kenyan National Police launched a cyber-center to respond to crimes involving online exploitation of children, including child trafficking. The government also expanded an information system for collecting and aggregating data related to child protection, including cases related to the worst forms of child labor, and drafted new procedures and guidelines for law enforcement's handling of cases involving children. However, children in Kenya engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic service and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Kenya has yet to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. In addition, the gap between the compulsory education age and minimum age for work leaves children ages 14–16 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The government also has not committed sufficient resources to child labor law enforcement.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Kiribati made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Employment and Human Resources took steps to draft regulations related to light work for children and on the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Kiribati perform dangerous tasks in construction and street vending. Existing laws do not identify hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children and do not prohibit the domestic trafficking of children. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to combat the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Kosovo made a moderate advancement to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed the Law on Child Protection (LCP), which will enter into force in July 2020 and prohibits the recruitment of children into non-state armed groups and provides additional penalties for producing, using, or involving children in the production, possession, or procurement of child pornography. In addition, the government identified significantly more criminal child labor violations in 2019 compared to 2018 and initiated prosecutions in nearly all cases. Furthermore, the Kosovo Police and Kosovo Prosecutorial Council established specialized interview rooms to make child victims of abuse feel more comfortable. However, children in Kosovo engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The labor inspectorate and Centers for Social Work face financial and human resource constraints that may impede their ability to adequately address child labor. In addition, human trafficking shelters lack sufficient funding to properly accommodate and care for child trafficking victims.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, the Kyrgyz Republic made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a policy package that established a National Referral Mechanism for victims of human trafficking, and drafted a new National Action Plan for 2020–2024 on the prevention and eradication of child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Kyrgyz Republic is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it implemented a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. As of January 1, 2019, the government instituted a moratorium on unannounced labor inspections. Inspections can only be conducted in response to a formal complaint, and must be approved and announced by the Ministry of Economy before a site visit can occur. Children in the Kyrgyz Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Protections to children granted in the Labor Code, such as the minimum age of employment, are not extended to children engaged in non-contractual employment, and research indicates that the State Inspectorate on Ecological and Technical Safety employed an insufficient number of labor inspectors. In addition, the scope of social programs to combat child labor was insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Lebanon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Social Affairs began implementing the National Action Plan to End Street Begging by Children with a public outreach program, and the Ministry of Labor took steps to review the Labor Code with the goal of raising the minimum age for work to 15, which would align with Lebanon's compulsory education age. Moreover, the Internal Security Forces institutionalized entry training for its cadets on child rights and protection. In addition, the government improved access to education with a policy allowing all refugees to enroll in public schools regardless of whether they have the required documentation for school enrollment. However, children in Lebanon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in construction and in forced labor in agriculture. Children also engage in child labor in the production of potatoes and tobacco. Laws related to forced labor do not meet international standards as there is no legislative provision that provides criminal penalties for forced labor, and debt bondage is not criminally prohibited. Furthermore, the Ministry of Labor’s budget was unable to cover equipment, personnel, and transport costs to conduct inspections. In addition, labor inspectors do not have the authority to inspect informal workplaces, where child labor in Lebanon is most prominent, and programs targeting child labor remained insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Lesotho made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Lesotho ratified ILO Protocol 29 to the Forced Labor Convention of 1930 and published data relevant to child labor from the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and the Violence Against Children Survey. However, children in Lesotho engage in the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks related to animal herding and domestic work. Lesotho’s compulsory education age is below the minimum age for work, leaving children in between these ages vulnerable to child labor. The government also lacks sufficient mechanisms to combat child labor, and labor inspections are not conducted in high-risk sectors, including the informal sector. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Liberia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Justice successfully prosecuted one case of child trafficking and the government endorsed the National Action Plan on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. However, children in Liberia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of rubber and the mining of gold and diamonds. In addition, Liberia has yet to accede to the UN CRC Protocol on Armed Conflict and the Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography and the minimum age for work is not in compliance with international standards. Social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Madagascar made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published data on child labor and ratified International Labor Organization conventions C189 on domestic workers and the 2014 Protocol to the 1930 Convention on Forced Labor, both potentially relevant to addressing child labor. The Ministry of Labor also took important steps toward modifying its Labor Code to grant the inspectorate sanction authority. In addition, the government began a process to renew its National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and the National Bureau to Combat Human Trafficking led efforts to develop a human trafficking database. Although Madagascar made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, the government failed to impose penalties for child labor violations and failed to investigate public officials suspected of facilitating the worst forms of child labor. Children in Madagascar engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. Children also perform dangerous tasks while mining mica and in agriculture, including in the production of vanilla. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor, and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Malawi made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government elevate the Tobacco Commission to enforce the Tobacco Industry Bill, which requires tobacco growers to report on efforts to eliminate child labor in tobacco farming, and significantly increased funding of its labor inspectorate. In addition, key coordinating bodies contributed to the development of a Child Labor Mainstreaming Guide, which advises government departments and public sector organizations on integrating child labor prevention and elimination into their activities. However, children in Malawi continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the harvesting of tobacco and in commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, gaps continue to exist in labor law enforcement related to child labor, including financial resource allocation, and minimum age protections do not extend to children working in private homes and non-commercial farms.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Maldives made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government passed a new Child Rights Protection Act, which takes steps to ensure compliance with international child protection laws and standards. In addition, the National Anti-Human Trafficking Steering Committee met for the first time in more than 2 years. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Maldives engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government has not determined specific hazardous occupations or activities that are prohibited for children, and the law does not sufficiently prohibit the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Moreover, the government does not have a policy or program that addresses all relevant worst forms of child labor in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Mali made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government allocated $350,000 to anti-trafficking efforts, including training judges, prosecutors, police, and civil society members on Mali's anti-trafficking law. The government also published data on enforcement efforts, including the number of labor inspections conducted and violations identified, in addition to drafting two new laws that increase penalties for trafficking crimes and exploitation of migrant children. In addition, the government published a new mining code that prohibits the use of child labor in artisanal mining. However, children in Mali engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in the production of cotton and rice. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, the Malian Armed Forces also recruited and used 24 children ages 9 to 16 in support roles for at least 2 years, in violation of its national law. Although the children were released in November 2019 following high-level engagement, there is no evidence that government officials were sanctioned for the recruitment and use of the children. Further, Mali's law only prohibits hereditary slavery as a result of human trafficking, does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, and allows children under age 18 to be penalized as a direct result of forced recruitment by armed groups. In addition, resource constraints severely limited the government’s ability to fully implement the National Plan to Combat Child Labor, and social and rehabilitation services for victims of the worst forms of child labor are inadequate.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Mauritania made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Unlike previous years when the government did not adequately prosecute or secure convictions in slavery cases, the government investigated, prosecuted, and convicted 12 perpetrators in 3 cases of slavery during the reporting period. In addition, it created and funded a new agency, Taazour, to assist vulnerable populations, including communities of slave descent. The government also revised laws on trafficking in persons and eased requirements for registering non-governmental organizations. However, despite making meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, Mauritania is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a policy and a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Although there were indications of progress, criminal law enforcement authorities did not make adequate efforts to combat slavery and its vestiges during the reporting period. Specifically, prosecution and convictions in slavery cases are isolated, and reports continue to indicate that some government actors, including police and judicial authorities, are unwilling to pursue such cases. In addition, since 2011, the government has required proof of marriage and biological parents’ citizenship for children to obtain a birth certificate. As a result, children born out of wedlock and many Haratine and Sub-Saharan ethnic minority children, including those of slave descent, have been prevented from being registered at birth. Because birth certificates are required for enrollment in secondary school in Mauritania, children as young as age 12 cannot access education, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mauritania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary slavery. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in herding cattle and goats. The government did not make sufficient efforts to enforce some laws related to the worst forms of child labor, including laws on hereditary slavery. In addition, lack of financial resources severely limited the government's ability to fully implement policies, and social programs to combat the worst forms of child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

The government approved the Workers' Rights Act, which strengthened protections for working children, and continued to implement social programs to support public education around the country. However, children in Mauritius engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities. Children also engage in child labor in construction and street work. The government did not collect nor publish data on criminal law enforcement, and gaps remain in the implementation of key policies and social programs related to child labor. </Description>

        <Description>For the 2019 reporting period, no assessment has been made regarding Mexico's efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because this is the first year that efforts have been assessed and suggested actions are included for Mexico. During the reporting period, the Government of Mexico made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas to combat the worst forms of child labor, including the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the revision of the General Education Law to strengthen educational access for children from marginalized groups. The government also obtained convictions in 12 cases of child trafficking, established a new commission for the protection of migrant children, and drafted the Plan of Action to Combat Child Labor 2019–2024. Furthermore, the government carried out its 2019 National Child Labor Survey, and continued to fund and support a program that improved educational access for over 73,000 indigenous and Afro-descendant children. However, children in Mexico engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of chile peppers, coffee, sugarcane, and tomatoes. Although nearly 60 percent of employment occurs in the informal sector, federal and some state-level labor inspectors are only permitted to carry out inspections in the informal sector in response to complaints. In addition, a lack of human and financial resources limited the government's ability to adequately enforce labor and criminal law, and the government did not publish complete information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Furthermore, social programs to combat child labor do not address all relevant sectors of child labor in Mexico.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Moldova made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established the National Council on Human Rights to monitor and assess efforts to comply with national and international obligations to combat child labor, and established an annex specifically for child victims of trafficking within state-run shelters. In addition, the Anti-Trafficking Bureau's mandate was expanded to include investigations of all forms of online child sexual exploitation. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Moldova is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law and practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In August 2018, the government amended Law No. 131 through Law No. 179, such that unannounced inspections, even those based on a complaint or at the request of law enforcement or other state bodies, are permitted only on the basis of a risk assessment that indicates an immediate threat to the environment, life, health, or property. This stringent measure severely limited the State Labor Inspectorate's ability to conduct unannounced inspections. In addition, announced inspections are only permitted after the State Labor Inspectorate first requests and receives insufficient documentation from the business being inspected or after conducting a risk assessment that finds reasonable indicators of a possible violation. Moreover, when an inspection is conducted in response to a complaint, the labor inspector must only focus on the alleged violation outlined in the complaint; if other violations, such as child labor, are uncovered, they cannot be addressed. Children in Moldova engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Moldova lacks a sufficient number of labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce. Furthermore, training is needed for new criminal investigators. In addition, entities responsible for conducting occupational, safety, and health inspections, including of hazardous child labor, lacked adequate capacity to do so during the reporting period.      </Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Mongolia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a resolution partially addressing the use of children as horse jockeys by banning horse racing and training during the months of November to May. Furthermore, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, in coordination with the International Labor Organization, drafted a revised Labor Law in that would allow unannounced labor inspections. The government also expanded the Children’s Money Program to cover all children in Mongolia, whereas it had previously only covered approximately 60 percent of Mongolian children. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mongolia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a regression in law that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. During the reporting period, the government did not permit the labor inspectorate to conduct unannounced inspections, which may have impeded the enforcement of child labor laws. Children in Mongolia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining and horse jockeying. Mongolia continues to have a number of legal statutes that do not meet international standards, including that the minimum age for work does not apply to children in the informal sector or to those who are self-employed. In addition, laws do not establish criminal penalties for forced labor or slavery, the use of children in prostitution, or the use, procurement, or offering of a child for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Montenegro made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted the new Strategy for Exercising the Rights of the Child in Montenegro, which aims to improve safeguards for children, including protection from violence and commercial sexual exploitation. The government also increased the labor inspectorate's budget, and convicted and sentenced two individuals for child sex trafficking, while indicting another for the trafficking of four children for labor exploitation. However, children in Montenegro engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government did not publish or make available information on criminal prosecutions initiated during the reporting period. In addition, research found that the scope of programs to address child labor in street work and forced begging is insufficient.</Description>

The government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the law does not prohibit the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Morocco made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted Law 51.17, which requires the government to enact compulsory education for children between the ages of 4 and 16 by 2025, and significantly increased the number of prosecutions related to the worst forms of child labor, from 5 cases in 2018 to 170 cases in 2019. However, children in Morocco engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work. Children also engage in child labor in producing artisanal handicrafts. Laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties. In addition, research could not determine whether penalties were imposed for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. Furthermore, the scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Mozambique made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved an update to new Penal Code, which includes prohibitions on human trafficking, child prostitution, and the use of children in pornography. Numerous trafficking in persons trainings were conducted throughout the country for border police officers, social service providers, judges, and investigators. In addition, Provincial and District National Reference Groups were trained on available referral mechanisms and social protection services for children and victims of human trafficking, and the drafting of the National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons was finalized. Nearly 5,000 awareness-raising events were also organized throughout all of Mozambique's 11 provinces on human trafficking, the worst forms of child labor, and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. However, children in Mozambique engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of tobacco. Although Mozambique made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the established minimum age for work is not in compliance with international labor standards because it does not extend to informal employment. In addition, a coordination mechanism to address child labor is lacking and existing programs are insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem in Mozambique.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Namibia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government brought into force the Child Care and Protection Act, increasing protections for children from the worst forms of child labor, and began implementing an updated National Agenda for Children, which aims to strengthen enforcement of laws related to child labor. The government also began implementing the Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act, which significantly strengthens penalties for trafficking crimes and provides mechanisms to increase the protection of child trafficking victims. In addition, the government increased the number of criminal prosecutions related to the worst forms of child labor, developed a national referral mechanism for responding to trafficking cases, and worked with NGOs to provide social and psychological support to child trafficking victims, including rehabilitation into schools. However, children in Namibia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in domestic work and street work. Hazardous work prohibitions for children in the agricultural sector are not comprehensive. In addition, social programs do not address child labor in agriculture and domestic work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Nepal made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published the Nepal Labor Force Survey Report, with data on child labor and forced labor. In addition, the government introduced a new education policy during the reporting year, providing free and compulsory education to all children. The police also created a new anti-trafficking bureau to assist in child victims' rescue and rehabilitation, as well as coordination with the Department of Labor on cases of hazardous child labor. However, children in Nepal engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of bricks. The Department of Labor’s budget, the number of labor inspectors, and available resources and training are all insufficient for enforcing labor laws, including those related to child labor. Furthermore, children age 17 are excluded from the protections of the country’s hazardous work list, leaving them vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Nicaragua made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government signed 6,129 cooperative agreements with employers to prevent the hiring of minors and released some information related to its labor law enforcement efforts. However, children in Nicaragua engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Laws do not establish a clear compulsory education age and national policies to eliminate child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented. The government also lacks a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor and the government reallocated resources away from activities such as preventing child labor and enforcing related laws.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Niger made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The President signed legislation establishing Child Protection Committees in each commune to educate the public on the rights of children and child labor issues. The government also opened the first shelter for victims of human trafficking, which can accommodate children. In addition, the national police detained 242 individuals suspected of human trafficking, dismantling 27 national and 29 international routes for human trafficking and illicit migration. However, children in Niger engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cattle herding. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the minimum age for work does not meet international standards as it does not apply to children in unpaid or non-contractual work. Gaps in labor law enforcement also remain, including insufficient funding for labor inspectors to conduct inspections. In addition, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Nigeria made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched two new state-level task forces to combat human trafficking in Delta and Ondo states. Children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in quarrying granite, artisan mining, commercial sexual exploitation, and armed conflict, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Child's Right Act has only been adopted by 25 out of Nigeria's 36 states, leaving the remaining 11 states in northern Nigeria with legal statutes that do not meet international standards for the prohibition of child trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, and illicit activities. In addition, the minimum age for work in the Labour Act does not apply to children who are self-employed or working in the informal economy, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age to work. Furthermore, the number of labor inspectors does not meet the ILO's technical advice for the size of Nigeria's workforce, and social programs do not address all relevant sectors.</Description>

        <Description>Research found no evidence that child labor exists in Niue, and in 2019, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Niue has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists on Norfolk Island, in 2019 the government made a moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Australia enacted the Modern Slavery Act, which applies to Norfolk Island, and took steps to begin consultations on a revised National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery. Although Norfolk Island made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, its legal framework does not have a minimum age for work for children. In addition, laws related to child trafficking do not meet international standards because the recruitment, harboring, transfer, and receipt of children for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation are not prohibited.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, North Macedonia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The parliament implemented changes to the existing Labor Law, which provided additional protections for children under the age of 15, and those who have not completed compulsory education. In addition, the Ministry of Education and Science implemented a new law that requires the hiring of educational mediators with the goal of removing barriers to education for Roma children. The government also increased the enrollment of children from vulnerable groups in primary school by accommodating first time and returnee students, and providing scholarships to vulnerable children. However, children in North Macedonia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships. Local police entities have also demonstrated a lack of knowledge on handling cases pertaining to trafficking in persons. Moreover, the government has not adopted a policy to address all worst forms of child labor, with the exception of child trafficking.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Oman made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Social Development issued regulations for determining whether a child is employed in a family business and for the medical examinations that a business must complete before employing a child. In addition, the National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking conducted two multi-day training programs on human trafficking for government officials and the Ministry of Manpower released a video in Arabic and English that clarified the rights and responsibilities of migrant workers. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Oman engage in child labor, including in fishing and selling items in kiosks. Government policies do not address all forms of child labor and the Ministry of Manpower is not represented on the National Committee on Implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In addition, the government did not provide information on the amount of the labor inspectorate’s funding, the number of inspectors, or training for inclusion in this report.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Pakistan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Punjab Province adopted the Punjab Domestic Workers Act of 2019, which prohibits children under age 15 from working in any domestic service capacity. In addition, the Islamabad Capital Territory established its Child Protection Advisory Board, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provincial labor departments earmarked specific funds from their budgets to conduct child labor surveys. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province also established a dedicated child labor unit. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Pakistan is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it implemented a regression in policy and practice that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. In September 2019, Punjab Province—home to more than 50 percent of the Pakistani population and two-thirds of the country’s textile factories, which employ 40 percent of the Punjab labor force—instituted a moratorium on all labor inspections in factories. This moratorium increases the likelihood that child labor violations will remain undetected and unaddressed and allows perpetrators to operate with impunity. Children in Pakistan are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in forced labor in brick kilns and agriculture. The federal government and Balochistan Province have not established a minimum age for work or hazardous work in compliance with international standards. In addition, provincial labor inspectorates do not receive sufficient resources to adequately enforce laws prohibiting child labor, and the federal and provincial governments failed to publish data on their efforts to enforce criminal or labor laws related to child labor. Further, police corruption, particularly the taking of bribes from suspected perpetrators to ignore child labor crimes and lack of willingness to conduct investigations, hindered Pakistan's ability to address the problem throughout the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Panama made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented the Districts Free of Child Labor initiative through anti-child labor agreements with six municipalities. The government also made improvements to the Child Labor Monitoring System to streamline responses to cases of child labor from different agencies, and continued to expand labor inspector trainings and unannounced inspections. In addition, the Ministry of Labor implemented the Direct Government Action Program for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor, which includes a new national survey on child labor. However, children in Panama engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Panamanian law allows minors under age 16 to engage in hazardous work within training facilities in violation of international standards. Moreover, the Ministry of Labor lacks the authority to collect fines for labor violations, limiting its capacity to enforce laws on the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Papua New Guinea made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Office of Child and Family Services conducted trainings for Child Protection Officers. However, children in Papua New Guinea are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Papua New Guinea's hazardous work prohibitions do not comply with international standards that require all children under 18 to be protected from work that could jeopardize their health and safety, nor do its laws prohibit using, procuring, or offering a child for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Schools started charging fees as a result of not receiving promised government subsidies needed for education to remain free and accessible for all children. Lastly, insufficient resources hamper the labor inspectorate’s capacity to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Paraguay made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The labor inspectorate increased its budget in order to hire more inspectors; inspectors received training on forced labor, trafficking in persons, child labor, and agricultural inspections; and judges were trained on the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security and the Ministry of Children and Adolescents also signed an agreement to strengthen inter-agency coordination on child labor, and the latter launched the Immediate Response Program to provide support to street children. In addition, the government updated the National Strategy for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor and Protection of Working Adolescents for the 2019–2024 period, with a focus on strengthening minimum family incomes, inspection of adolescent work, and access to quality education. Finally, the government enacted a law that provides domestic workers with the same minimum wage as all other workers, effectively changing a law that previously provided domestic workers with only 60 percent of the national minimum wage. However, children in Paraguay are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in debt bondage in cattle raising and in domestic servitude, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Limited funding for law enforcement agencies and social programs hampered the government’s ability to fully address the worst forms of child labor, particularly in rural areas.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Peru made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published a law modifying the Penal Code to strengthen penalties for the sexual exploitation of women and minors and drafted an executive decree to establish a standardized government procedure to register adolescent workers. Under Operation Mercury to stop illegal gold mining, Peruvian authorities also dismantled a human trafficking network in the Madre de Dios region. In addition, the government renewed the National Plan to Combat Forced Labor for the 2019–2022 period and the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations approved a guide for the reintegration of human trafficking victims. Moreover, under the Semilla Project, the Ministry of Labor created the Child Labor Free Seal which recognizes products and services whose supply chains are free of child labor. However, children in Peru engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Peruvian law allows children ages 12 to 14 to do light work without specifying the activities in which children may work. In addition, labor law enforcement agencies in Peru lack sufficient inspectors and training to adequately combat child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, the Philippines made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The President signed Executive Order No. 92 institutionalizing the National Council Against Child Labor to help further implement the Philippines Program Against Child Labor Strategic Framework. The government also permanently closed nine establishments found to be in violation of child labor laws, and launched the 6-year #SaferKidsPH campaign, which aims to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of cases of online commercial sexual exploitation of children. Additionally, through new Republic Act No. 11310, the government institutionalized the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, which is a conditional cash transfer program that focuses on reducing child labor. However, children in the Philippines engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and gold mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it did not adequately protect children allegedly engaged in drug trafficking from inappropriate incarceration, penalties for crimes they were forced to commit, or physical harm. Additionally, research was unable to find evidence that the government investigated police officers accused of extrajudicial killings of children during anti-drug operations in 2019. The enforcement of child labor laws remains challenging, especially due to the limited number of inspectors, lack of resources for inspections, and inspectors’ inability to assess penalties.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Rwanda made a moderate advancement in efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor. The government published its first ever comprehensive study examining human trafficking trends in the country and completed the drafting of a light work framework for children working under the minimum age. The government also removed 316 children from hazardous work situations, and punished 74 employers with fines totaling about $3,000. Children in Rwanda engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The number of labor inspectors does not meet the ILO's technical advice for the size of the workforce. In addition, Rwandan law potentially allows authorities to place children engaged in labor in transit centers, where children are often subject to physical abuse. Finally, social programs did not address all relevant sectors where child labor was present.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha (formerly Saint Helena), in 2019 the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Children and Adults Social Care Directorate updated its policy on child exploitation, which includes sexual and criminal exploitation. However, the government has yet to define by law or regulation the types of work prohibited to children, other than work on vessels engaged in maritime navigation. Gaps also remain in legislation related to forced child labor and the trafficking of children for labor exploitation.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Saint Lucia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a trafficking in persons hotline and the Ministry of Home Affairs, National Security, and Justice implemented a case management system for victims of human trafficking. In addition, the government assumed full financial responsibility for an International Organization for Migration program, which aims to counter human trafficking. A rapid assessment conducted by the International Labor Organization in 2016 revealed limited evidence that children in Saint Lucia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in the sale and distribution of drugs. Saint Lucia's law does not sufficiently protect children from hazardous work and illicit activities. The government also does not have any policies addressing all forms of child labor, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Unit trained criminal law enforcement personnel on identifying child labor, child trafficking, and commercial sexual exploitation of children. The government also conducted public awareness-raising seminars at primary and secondary schools, reaching over 1,500 students and 70 teachers. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps remain in the legal framework, as the minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards and there is no law to prohibit the use of children in the production of drugs. In addition, the law does not prohibit the use of children for prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Samoa made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Samoa continued to fund the Government Grant to Mission and Public Schools. Children in Samoa are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street vending. Research found no evidence of laws that ban using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. While the government has a mechanism to coordinate interagency efforts to address child labor, it did not meet during the reporting period.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Senegal made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The country’s first national human trafficking database, "Systraite," was piloted in five regions, and the Ministry of Supervised Education and Social Protection released a multi-disciplinary action plan to address forced begging. However, children in Senegal engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include domestic work and street work, areas in which child labor is prevalent, and labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lack resources to adequately enforce child labor law. In addition, an overlap of mandated activities among mechanisms to coordinate efforts to address child labor creates confusion and obstructs effective collaboration.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Serbia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government implemented the Law on Simplified Hiring of Seasonal Labor in Certain Economic Areas to regulate seasonal work, including in agriculture where child labor occurs. The City of Belgrade also opened a shelter to provide services to street children. In addition, the government identified 21 child trafficking victims and 32 child labor violations. However, children in Serbia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Serbia's laws do not treat forced child beggars as victims of child labor and the country's social welfare centers are overburdened, which limits efforts to provide services to victims of child labor. In addition, investigations and prosecutions of child labor crimes significantly decreased in 2019 compared with 2018.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Sierra Leone made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In early 2020, the government officially overturned a 10-year-old policy that prohibited pregnant girls from attending regular public schools or taking secondary and post-secondary school entrance exams. The government also published a report on the results of a 2018 household-level survey on child labor and employment. However, children in Sierra Leone engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the mining sector and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in quarrying stone and fishing. The types of hazardous work prohibited for children do not cover all sectors where child labor is known to occur, and the government does not have a sufficient number of labor inspectors to adequately enforce labor laws throughout the country. In addition, Sierra Leone lacks a national policy and social program to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, the Solomon Islands made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Anti-Human Trafficking Advisory Committee was fully established and began meeting quarterly to coordinate the government's anti-human trafficking efforts. Further, the government actively investigated two child sex trafficking cases involving five children. However, children in the Solomon Islands are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of palm oil fruits. The minimum age for employment does not meet international standards, and the government has not comprehensively identified the hazardous occupations prohibited for children. In addition, education is not compulsory, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor exploitation.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practices that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Somalia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs unveiled an expansive social protection policy and finalized a National Employment Policy, while a newly established tripartite labor committee also drafted an action plan to eradicate child labor. Additionally, the Ministry of Defense committed to a UN Roadmap to end and prevent grave violations against children, including recruitment and use in combat. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Somalia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The Somali National Army continued to recruit and use children in armed conflict, in violation of its national law, during the reporting period. Somalia is also receiving this assessment because it lacks a labor inspectorate, and as such conducted no worksite labor inspections. Children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Somali laws do not criminally prohibit child trafficking for labor, commercial sexual exploitation, or the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, South Africa made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons National Policy Framework to help government agencies improve capacity and coordination on combatting trafficking in persons. However, children in South Africa engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging, each sometimes as the result of human trafficking. Labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties, and social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor. In addition, barriers to education remain, especially among children without proper identification documents and children with disabilities.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, South Sudan is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, South Sudan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because it demonstrated a practice of being complicit in the use of forced child labor in more than isolated incidents. State forces continued to recruit children, sometimes forcibly, to fight opposition groups. Otherwise, the government made efforts by signing a UN comprehensive action plan to end grave violations against children, and integrating a unit on child protection issues into the army's 2019 civic education curriculum. Children in South Sudan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict and cattle herding. The government did not hold perpetrators of child labor accountable and has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons. In addition, police continued to indiscriminately arrest and imprison children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation rather than treating them as victims. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Sri Lanka made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the budget for the labor inspectorate and increased the number of labor inspectors. The Sri Lanka Police also took action to investigate four cases involving the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition, the government approved the National Child Protection Policy as a measure to reduce child sex tourism. However, children in Sri Lanka engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Sri Lanka's hazardous work list is not comprehensive because it does not include domestic work. In addition, the labor inspectorate is not authorized to assess penalties for labor law violations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Suriname made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the National Action Plan to Combat Child Labor and drafted, approved, and implemented the National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons. The Ministry of Labor also adopted a referral network system developed by the Ministry of Social Affairs in collaboration with UNICEF, which aims to address violations of children's rights by not only removing children from exploitative situations, but by seeking solutions to the causes of their exploitation. In addition, the Trafficking in Persons Working Group launched an extensive awareness-raising campaign, including billboards, radio and television messaging, and the distribution of flyers at entry points throughout the country. However, children in Suriname engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. In addition, the compulsory education age does not reach the minimum age for employment, leaving some children vulnerable to labor exploitation.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, São Tomé and Príncipe made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Family Program to implement education policies and provide cash stipends to vulnerable families. However, children in São Tomé and Príncipe engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Labor Code permits children younger than age 14 to work under certain circumstances, which is not consistent with international standards. In addition, limited financial resources hampered law enforcement efforts and prevented the National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor from being implemented. Social programs also do not address child labor in all relevant sectors, including in agriculture.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, The United Republic of Tanzania made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Criminal law enforcement officers prosecuted, achieved convictions, and imposed sentences for two cases related to the worst forms of child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tanzania is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The Mainland government explicitly supports the routine expulsion of pregnant students from public schools, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Tanzania engage in the worst forms of child Iabor, including in mining, quarrying, and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain in the legal framework and enforcement of laws related to child labor, including protections for child engagement in illicit activities and domestic work; the lack of authorization for the labor inspectorate to assess penalties; and the likely insufficient number of labor inspectors for the size of Tanzania’s labor force.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Thailand made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its total number of labor inspections by six percent, and it worked to ensure migrant students educated at Migrant Learning Centers receive a government accredited certificate to allow them to pursue additional educational opportunities in Thailand or back in their native countries. The Ministry of Education issued a new regulation that allows non-Thai children to enroll in the formal school system and ensures that these children have access to free education and health services. The government also published the first nationally representative survey of working children in Thai. Thailand was also the first country in Asia to ratify ILO Convention 188, which came into force in January; Thailand also passed the 2019 Fishery Workers Protection Act and drafted regulations in the high-risk fishing sector. However, children in Thailand are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children, including those under 12, also participate in Muay Thai competitions, an area of hazardous work in which there is evidence of serious head injuries. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet the international standard for the minimum age for work because the law does not grant protections to children working outside a formal employment relationship. Enforcement of child labor laws remains a challenge due to an insufficient number of inspectors and resources to physically inspect remote workplaces in informal sectors.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Timor-Leste made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In October, the government released an analytical report on the findings of its 2016 National Child Labor Survey in conjunction with the Mini Labor Force Survey. Additionally, the government funded the Vulnerable Persons Unit to help support children who were victims of child labor and human trafficking. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Timor-Leste is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement due to a regression in practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. While no law or policy prohibits pregnant girls from attending school, reports during the reporting period indicate that orders from school principals forced girls to leave school when they became pregnant, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Timor-Leste engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. In addition, Timor-Leste’s Penal Code and Labor Code only protect children under the age of 17, leaving children age 17 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Togo made a minimal advancement in its efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government signed a tripartite agreement with the Governments of Benin and Burkina Faso to increase cooperation on efforts to combat child trafficking. However, children in Togo engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. The government has not devoted sufficient resources to combat child labor, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties for child labor violations. Coordinating bodies to combat child labor were not active during the reporting period, and the government does not collect and publish data related to its efforts to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

        <Description>Research found no evidence that child labor exists in Tokelau, and in 2019, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor, as the law does not criminally prohibit forced labor and child trafficking. In addition, Tokelau has not established a minimum age for work and does not prohibit hazardous occupations for children.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Tonga made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Education continued its program to increase access to education for children with disabilities. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tonga is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Research indicates there are no labor inspectors and there is no legal authority to conduct labor inspections. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in farming and fishing. Gaps in the legal framework also remain; the country has no laws specifying a minimum age for work or defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation. In addition, the government has not integrated child labor elimination and prevention strategies into a policy or program to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Tunisia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted a bill regulating the work of private recruitment agencies that send Tunisians to work abroad, creating new positions to monitor the activities of these agencies and note any fraud committed. It also published a new hazardous work list. In addition, it investigated allegations of child trafficking—including forced labor—at the Koranic association in Regueb, subsequently shutting down 11 other associations operating unauthorized Koranic schools in 6 different governorates. However, children in Tunisia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and begging, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in scavenging for garbage and in street work. The law’s minimum age protections cannot be enforced with respect to children who are engaged in work in the informal sector on inhabited premises, such as private homes, without permission of the property owner or a court order to access the property. The government also failed to provide data on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Tuvalu made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and conducted a baseline survey to map and assess its child protection system. Tuvalu also significantly increased the budget for its labor inspectorate during the reporting period. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Tuvalu engage in child labor in fishing and domestic work. The government has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Tuvalu lacks data to determine the prevalence and nature of child labor in the country.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Uganda made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor, and the Anti-Human Trafficking National Task Force published updated regulations to prevent trafficking in persons and drafted a new national action plan against human trafficking. In addition, the government approved funding to increase services to street children working in Kampala. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Uganda is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it implemented a regression in practice that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor.  The government failed to take active measures to prosecute, convict, and sentence public officials, including police and immigration officers, who participate in or facilitate the worst forms of child labor, including child trafficking. Despite public acknowledgement by the Speaker of Parliament of official complicity in child trafficking, no government officials have been held accountable for their role in facilitating child trafficking. Children in Uganda engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. The lack of a centralized supervisory authority, and inadequate funding, training, and resources, hampered the capacity of law enforcement agencies to conduct child labor inspections and investigations. Gaps in the legal framework persist, including insufficient laws regulating the minimum age for employment and hazardous work. In addition, existing programs are inadequate to address child labor in the country.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Ukraine made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted the Resolution on the Social Protection of Children and Urgent Measures to Protect the Rights of the Child, which includes a provision to address the participation of children in armed conflict. The government also cooperated with municipal leaders and international organizations to conduct mine safety education programs for children and provide security guarantees for demining activities near educational facilities. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Ukraine is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it implemented a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In August 2019, the government issued Cabinet of Ministers Decree No. 823, which requires that businesses receive notification at least 5 working days in advance of an onsite labor inspection; this decree prevents Ukraine's State Labor Inspectorate from conducting unannounced inspections. Children in Ukraine engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of pornography. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. The government collected few of the financial penalties imposed for child labor violations and lacked social programs designed to assist children engaged in hazardous work in mining. Children living in Russian-controlled areas in the east of the country are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation, and the Government of Ukraine does not have capacity to address the worst forms of child labor in these areas due to the ongoing conflict.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Uzbekistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government took active measures to prevent the use of child labor in the cotton harvest, including by introducing criminal penalties for repeat violations of hazardous work prohibitions, doubling the number of labor inspectors, and conducting extensive awareness-raising on child labor laws and penalties for violations. The government also established a new National Commission on Combating Trafficking in Persons and Forced Labor and adopted a new roadmap to combat trafficking in persons and forced labor. However, children in Uzbekistan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, laws prohibiting the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards. Uzbekistan also has not carried out a national child labor survey to determine the prevalence of child labor in sectors other than cotton production. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Vanuatu made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, Vanuatu acceded to ILO C. 138, setting the minimum age for work at 14. Although research is limited, children in Vanuatu engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in forestry. Vanuatu’s minimum age for hazardous work of age 15 is too low to comply with international standards. Vanuatu also lacks a referral mechanism between criminal authorities and social service providers. In addition, the Government of Vanuatu did not respond to requests for information for this report.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, the Palestinian Authority made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the areas of the West Bank under its control. It cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to provide educational services to 325,000 students and psychosocial support to over 97,000 children. However, children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in construction and illicit activities. Children also engage in child labor in street vending. The Palestinian Authority’s legal framework does not criminally prohibit all elements of child trafficking, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties. In addition, Palestinian Authority programs to prevent or eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Morocco made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kingdom of Morocco claims the territory of Western Sahara and administers the area that it controls by the same constitution, laws, and structures as in internationally-recognized Morocco, including laws that deal with child labor. The government adopted Law 51.17, which requires the government to enact compulsory education for children between the ages of 4 and 16 by 2025 and significantly increased the number of prosecutions related to the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Western Sahara engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work. Children also engage in child labor in producing artisanal handicrafts. Laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards and the scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2019, Yemen made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Republic of Yemen Government progressed in its implementation of the Action Plan to End and Prevent the Recruitment of Children by the Yemeni Armed Forces by appointing 90 child protection focal points within the Yemeni armed forces and training 40 of them to identify children within their ranks. In addition, the government released 25 children conscripted by Houthi forces and subsequently captured to the Marib interim care center for rehabilitation. Despite these initiatives to address child labor, Yemen is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement practices that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. There is evidence of recruitment and use of children in hostilities by state armed forces in contravention of Yemeni law and despite government efforts to counter child soldier recruitment. Furthermore, the government failed to make efforts to address discrimination in schools against children from the Muhamasheen community, leading to their increased vulnerability to child labor. Children in Yemen engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and armed conflict, including by Houthi insurgent forces and other armed groups. Children also engage in child labor in fishing. Research found no evidence of a policy on worst forms of child labor outside of child soldiering, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child trafficking. </Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Zambia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased the number of prosecutions for crimes related to the worst forms of child labor and expanded the powers of the labor inspectorate to assess penalties for labor violations. The government also established a new National Coordinating Committee for Children to enhance responses on child protection issues, including child trafficking, sexual exploitation of children, and child labor. However, children in Zambia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Education Act does not specify a compulsory education age, and human trafficking laws are discordant with international standards because they require threats, the use of force, or coercion to establish the crime of child trafficking. In addition, labor inspectors lack sufficient financial and human resources to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

        <Description>In 2019, Zimbabwe made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved an updated Trafficking in Persons National Plan of Action for 2019–2021, and with support from UNICEF, published new data on the prevalence of child labor in Zimbabwe. In addition, the government initiated prosecutions related to trafficking of children. However, children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, mining, and tobacco production, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the harvesting of sugar cane. Law enforcement agencies lack resources to enforce child labor laws. In addition, gaps remain in the country’s legal framework against child labor, including the lack of free basic education, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor.</Description>
