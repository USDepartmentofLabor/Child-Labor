        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Afghanistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Although Afghanistan made some efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, government officials are complicit in the use of forced commercial sexual exploitation of boys through the practice of bacha bazi. The government opened a juvenile rehabilitation center for children previously engaged in armed conflict and provided services to 34 children. It also opened child protection units in 27 provinces, which helped prevent the recruitment of 364 children into the Afghan National Police. The Child Protection Action Network provided educational and social services to at-risk internally displaced families and removed 50 children from mines where they engaged in child labor and enrolled them in schools. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the government was also complicit in the use of forced child labor. Afghanistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because government officials, particularly officers of the Afghan Local Police and Afghan National Army, are complicit in the practice of bacha bazi and, unlike in previous years, did not make meaningful efforts to address this crime during the reporting period. Afghan Local Police officers and members of the military continued to recruit children for the purpose of bacha bazi and, in at least one case, police sexually assaulted a boy who sought police assistance to report his exploitation in bacha bazi. The government lacked the political will to enforce laws prohibiting bacha bazi and, despite receiving more than 63 cases of bacha bazi among Afghan military and police, did not initiate any prosecutions or achieve any convictions for bacha bazi. Children in Afghanistan also engage in other worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict and forced labor in the production of bricks and carpets. Afghanistan’s Labor Inspectorate is not authorized to impose penalties for child labor violations, and the government lacks sufficient programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Albania made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted the Decision of the Council of Ministers No.91, which establishes rules and procedures to follow when a child's rights have been violated and strengthens the role of the State Agency for Rights and Protection of Children. Moreover, it adopted the Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 353 to regulate the functioning of the cross-sectorial technical group to adequately address child protection needs. The government also increased the number of child protection units, trained police officers on countering child trafficking, and volunteered to be a Pathfinder Country for Alliance 8.7 in order to expedite the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals related to eliminating child labor and human trafficking by 2025. However, children in Albania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and mining chromium. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the law does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities. In addition, the labor inspectorate needs to be strengthened so it can inspect all sectors in which child labor is known to occur.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Algeria made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In addition to conducting routine labor inspections, the government conducted a dedicated period of inspections focused solely on child labor, and achieved 98 convictions. The National Committee for the Prevention of and Fight Against Trafficking in Persons held six public events to raise awareness on human trafficking and training sessions for law enforcement and judicial personnel. The government also altered policy regarding labor law enforcement, allowing labor inspectors to assess penalties on those who violated labor laws. However, children in Algeria engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous street work tasks. The government has not sufficiently prohibited the use of children in illicit activities or determined by national law or regulation the types of work that are hazardous for children to perform. Furthermore, the government's number of labor inspectors is not in accordance with the ILO's technical advice to ensure that child labor laws are enforced in all geographic areas.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Angola made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the Penal Code, which prohibits the use of children for the production of pornography. It also approved a National Action Plan to Combat Child Labor, which aims to eliminate child labor by strengthening the rights of children, including increasing their access to education, and mapping child labor found throughout the country to better inform policies and programs. In addition, the government deployed the Southern African Development Community Trafficking in Persons regional database, which collects national data to facilitate the development and implementation of policies and programs to combat human trafficking. However, children in Angola engage in forced labor in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. The gap between the compulsory education age and minimum age for work leaves children ages 12 and 13 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. There are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce, and social programs do not target all sectors in which children work. </Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Anguilla, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018. During the reporting period, the government worked with the United Kingdom's Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service to develop a National Social Protection Policy and Action Plan and provided awareness-raising sessions, school programs, training, and workshops on child protection. However, the law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities and the minimum age for work does not meet international standards.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Argentina made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The new Secretariat of Labor worked with Argentina's National Institute of Statistics and Census to publish the country's first national child labor survey, with representation from every region in the country. Provincial courts also rendered the first ever criminal conviction for child labor in Argentina. In July 2018, the government approved the 2018–2020 Action Plan against Human Trafficking and Exploitation. In addition, the Secretariat of Labor and Special Prosecutor for Human Trafficking published guides for investigators and justice sector officials in understanding and applying Argentina's human trafficking and child labor legislation. However, children in Argentina engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities such as the sale and distribution of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government does not publish federal and provincial labor and criminal law enforcement data on child labor, and social programs that address child labor in agriculture do not appear to address the full scope of the problem.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Armenia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new program to protect children's rights. In addition, it continued to pursue labor inspection reform, including establishing the Health and Labor Inspection Body; this body, however, will have limited ability to monitor prohibitions on hazardous child labor. Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Armenia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because the government has lacked a functioning labor inspectorate since the 2014 repeal of Article 34 of the Labor Code, which previously established the government's authority to implement labor legislation and collective agreements. Since that time, the government has lacked a mechanism to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws, including a mechanism with the authority to conduct unannounced inspections. Children in Armenia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government lacks a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address all forms of child labor, including its worst forms. In addition, no government programs exist to aid children engaged in work activities in agriculture.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>  In 2018, Azerbaijan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the State Program on developing official statistics, including on child labor, for 2018–2025 and drafted a new National Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in Persons for 2019–2023. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In 2017, the government extended a moratorium on all labor inspections through 2021, which will continue to leave potential violations of child labor laws undetected in workplaces. Children in Azerbaijan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Legal protections only apply to workers with written employment contracts, leaving self-employed children and children working outside of formal employment relationships vulnerable to exploitation. In addition, research found limited evidence of government programs to address child labor in agriculture, the sector in which child labor is most prevalent.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Bangladesh made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a $35 million, 3-year project to eliminate hazardous child labor by identifying and rehabilitating100,000 child laborers. In addition, the Bangladesh Army and Rapid Action Battalion were deployed to assist in the identification and investigation of trafficking and smuggling cases among Rohingya refugees. The government also adopted a five-year National Plan of Action for the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking. However, children in Bangladesh engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced child labor in the production of dried fish and bricks. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of garments and leather goods. Laws do not cover children working in the informal sector, and hazardous work prohibitions are not comprehensive. Moreover, the number of labor inspectors is insufficient for the size of Bangladesh’s workforce, and fines are too low to deter child labor law violations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Belize made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted legislation to create a hazardous work list and light work framework and created a curriculum for labor inspectors to help identify child workers. The Labor Department appointed a Senior Labor Officer dedicated specifically to child labor and improving interagency coordination. In addition, the government expanded its secondary school subsidy program to serve all rural areas in the country. However, children in Belize engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, fishing, and construction. Although Belize made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the country's minimum age for work is 12 and does not meet international standards. In addition, the country lacks prohibitions against the use of children in illicit activities. Also, the government does not appear to have programs that aim to reduce child labor in agriculture, except in the sugar industry.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Benin made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved a National Action Plan for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, and approved a new Penal Code that enhances protections to victims of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. During the year authorities provided temporary shelter and assistance to 1,214 child victims of trafficking and exploitation. However, children in Benin engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of cotton and crushed granite. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work and street vending. Children with disabilities have no access to the regular education system, leaving these children at risk of becoming victims of child labor and exploitation. In addition, limited resources for the adequate enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Bhutan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted standard operating procedures for identifying and referring human trafficking victims. In addition, government personnel received training on human trafficking. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Bhutan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Bhutan’s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards and education is not compulsory. The government has not adopted a national policy to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Bolivia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Following the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal(TCP) decision that ruled unconstitutional provisions of the 2014 Child and Adolescent Code which allowed children as young as 10 years old to work, in December 2018President Evo Morales signed complementary legislation that further clarified the minimum age of 14 years. The legislation eliminated remaining provisions that permitted children to work at ages 12 and 13. The labor inspectorate also increased the number of labor inspectors, mobile inspection units, and the number of inspections conducted throughout the year. In addition, the major sugar-producing Department of Santa Cruz addressed child labor in the sector through several social programs. However, children in Bolivia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although Bolivian law requires that apprentices attend school, it does not set a minimum age for participation in apprenticeships. In addition, Article 1 of Supreme Decree No. 1875 sets the minimum age for compulsory military service at 17 years, which does not comply with international standards.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Bosnia and Herzegovina made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government's Daily Centers identified 130 children as potential victims of human trafficking and referred them to shelters, and the number of Regional Monitoring Teams is being increased from 4 to 17. In addition, the Government of Canton Sarajevo implemented a protocol on cooperation and treatment in cases of unlawful behavior at the detriment of children, which includes protection for child beggars and sexually abused children. However, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The minimum age protections in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and Brčko District do not apply to children who are self-employed or work outside of formal employment relationships. In addition, the Anti-Trafficking Strike Force lacks coordination between prosecutors, police, and other relevant government stakeholders, and border police officers and social workers failed to properly identify unaccompanied migrant and refugee children as potential victims of human trafficking due to lack of proper protocols.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Botswana made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government provided funding for education programs and supported school feeding programs. However, children in Botswana engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor in cattle herding, and forced domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Key gaps remain in the country’s legal framework, including the lack of a minimum age for compulsory education and insufficient prohibitions for hazardous work. In addition, social programs do not always reach intended child labor victims, especially those engaged in cattle herding and domestic work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Brazil made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In January 2018, the state of Ceará signed a law requiring businesses to publicly display signs highlighting the dangers of child labor and establishing administrative fines for those who violate the law, as well as those who fail to display the required signage. Furthermore, Brazilian police conducted the largest operation to date to combat child pornography, resulting in 89 arrests in more than24 states. The number of children removed from situations of forced child labor increased by 40 percent, from 1,008 children in 2017 to 1,854 in 2018. The government also adopted its third National Plan to Eradicate Child Labor, and its third National Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. However, children in Brazil engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Although Brazil made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government has not established legislation in compliance with international standards related to child trafficking. In addition, there are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce, and local government slack the capacity to fully implement and monitor the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor, Bolsa Família, and other social protection programs. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Burkina Faso made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the course of the reporting period, the government has removed more than 2,000 children from artisanal mining sites and placed them in the care of social services. The government also employed 255 full-time labor inspectors, an increase of more than 50 percent with respect to the previous reporting period, and launched a new National Program of Economic and Social Development, which includes child labor elimination and prevention strategies. However, children in Burkina Faso engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in artisanal gold mining and quarrying. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cotton harvesting. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may hinder government efforts to protect children from engaging in the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the Labor Code does not identify the activities in which children may engage in light work.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Although, Burma made some efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, government officials were complicit in the use of forced child labor. The government extended the Supplementary Understanding with the ILO to continue the forced labor complaint mechanism through 2018. During the June 2018 Union Peace Conference, the government also committed to the elimination of six grave violations against children, including the recruitment and use of children as soldiers. The government also established a mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor. Despite these initiatives, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement because, in previous years, it forcibly recruited children into its national armed forces, and there is a lack of evidence that it has fully ceased this practice and that these children have been released from the armed forces. The government's "self-reliance" policy has created an ongoing risk of forced labor in conflict areas as the national armed forces continues to coerce civilians, including children, to work as porters, cleaners, and cooks in conflict areas. In addition, several of the armed ethnic groups recruited and used children, including as combatants in armed conflict. Children in Burma engage in other worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Government policies increased children's vulnerability to the worst forms of child labor by denying Rohingya children, displaced by conflict, access to education because of government restrictions on their movements. The penalties imposed for recruiting and using children in the military are not sufficient for the seriousness of the crime. In addition, the government did not publish information on criminal law enforcement efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict cases involving the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Burundi made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government hired additional labor inspectors, more than doubling the number of those employed to enforce labor laws across the country. However, children in Burundi engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Burundi lacks a compulsory education age that is equal to the minimum age for work. The government’s ability to address the worst forms of child labor was constrained by a lack of necessary resources to conduct labor inspections and criminal investigations, alack of well-trained educators, materials, and infrastructure in the education sector, and insufficient social programs to address child labor in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Cabo Verde made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved and published its first National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons and revised the Education Law to extend free tuition up to the eighth grade. In July, the national government established the Observatory for Monitoring and Rapid Identification of Situations of Trafficking in Persons, a major coordinating body created to respond to all human trafficking situations around the archipelago, which convened twice during the year. However, children in Cabo Verde engage in the worst forms of  child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Law enforcement officials lack the necessary resources to follow up on investigations, and communication between enforcement agencies is limited. In addition, social programs to assist children involved in agriculture and domestic work are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Cambodia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government issued a Royal Decree authorizing the National Committee on Child Labor, within the Cambodian National Council for Children, to begin operations. In addition, the labor inspectorate revamped its factory inspection questionnaire to align with the ILO Better Factories Cambodia questionnaire. Moreover, the government institutionalized a counter trafficking in persons training curriculum for the Cambodian National Police Academy. However, children in Cambodia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in brickmaking, as well as in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Due to challenges in accessing basic education and the absence of a compulsory education requirement, children are vulnerable to involvement in the worst forms of child labor. Insufficient resources also may hamper the labor inspectorate's capacity to enforce child labor laws, especially in rural areas and where the majority of child laborers work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Cameroon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government more than doubled the number of labor inspectors, and removed more than 300 children from situations of exploitation and provided them with social services. It also hired more than 3,000 teachers and expanded the scope of a school feeding program which aims to benefit 81,500 children in the Adamawa, East, North, and Northwest regions. However, children in Cameroon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cocoa production. The government has not acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. In addition, it has not prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, the Central African Republic made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Justice began drafting a law that will reinforce existing laws on the recruitment of children under the age of 18 by armed groups, and criminally prohibit recruitment by non-state groups. In addition, the government participated in the identification, removal, and referral to social services of more than1,800 children associated with armed groups, hired additional labor inspectors, and provided some inspectors with child labor-specific training. However, children in the Central African Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in diamond mining and armed conflict by non-state armed groups. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic work. An estimated 1.3 million children lacked access to education as a result of ongoing instability, and limited resources hampered the government’s implementation of policies and programs to address child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Chad made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In March 2018, the Government of Chad ratified an ordinance prohibiting trafficking in persons and sent three labor inspectors to attend a 45-day refresher training at the ILO-accredited African Regional Center for Labor Administration in Cameroon. The government also launched the Refugees and Host Communities Support Project, which aims to improve access to health and education services for refugees, including children engaged in the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Chad engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in cattle herding and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The country’s legal framework does not contain criminal penalties for the use of children in illicit activities, and austerity measures imposed in 2016 continue to limit government funding for efforts to combat child labor. The government does not collect data on law enforcement efforts and has no active policies for relevant sectors of child labor, such as commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labor in domestic work and herding cattle.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Chile made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a law creating the Office for the Rights of Children, which is charged with disseminating, promoting, and protecting the rights of children and adolescents. The newly established Undersecretary for Childhood, whose designated objectives include ensuring the rights of children and adolescents and coordinating the provision of services, also created a new National Plan of Action for Children and Adolescents. In addition, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights created Chile's first National Human Rights Plan, which includes plans to complete and publish the results of an update to the 2012 child labor survey. However, children in Chile engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions related to forced labor do not meet international standards. In addition, there is a lack of publicly available enforcement information, including the number of criminal investigations and prosecutions related to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

Christmas Island does not meet the international standard for the prohibition of child trafficking. In addition, a gap in the legal framework for light work leaves children vulnerable to involvement in child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Colombia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted two new bills: one to strengthen penalties in the Penal Code for crimes of commercial sexual exploitation, and one to establish more comprehensive provisions to protect children against cyber crimes that involve commercial sexual exploitation. The Ministry of Labor also significantly increased its resources dedicated to labor law enforcement and launched the campaign "Working is Not a Child's Task," which aims to prevent and eliminate child labor through awareness raising efforts. The government adopted the National Policy on Childhood and Adolescence. It also began implementing the Center for the Crime of Trafficking in Persons, which collects information and analysis on human trafficking and uses this information to develop effective public policies. However, children in Colombia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, the government does not employ a sufficient number of labor inspectors. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Comoros made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government carried out labor inspections for the second consecutive year, adding unannounced inspections in 2018. Under the National Policy for the Protection of Children, the government also established two pilot listening sessions for child victims of violence and gathered data from the listening sessions to improve child protection. In addition, the National Commission of Human Rights and Freedoms and the General Delegation organized trainings for the police, gendarmerie, and army on children's rights. However, children in Comoros engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. A gap between the minimum age for work and compulsory education age leaves children ages 13 to 15 vulnerable to child labor. In addition, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government convicted two former militia leaders of war crimes, including for the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. The Ministry of Mines also launched a traceability and monitoring system for artisanal mines to detect cases of child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Research indicates that labor inspectors failed to conduct any worksite inspections for the third year in a row. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo detained and sometimes committed extra-judicial killing of boys due to their perceived support or affiliation with non-state armed groups. Children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, tin ore (cassiterite), tantalum ore (coltan), and tungsten ore (wolframite), and are used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups. Other gaps remain, including a lack of trained enforcement personnel, limited financial resources, poor coordination of government efforts to combat child labor, and laws mandating free primary education which are not enforced.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, the Republic of the Congo made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, enforcement agencies disrupted multiple sex trafficking networks involving children, including identifying at least seven child sex trafficking victims and one child victim of forced criminality. The government engaged with the Government of Benin to implement a bilateral agreement to combat human trafficking. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are involved in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government has yet to accede to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and there is no mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor at the national level, including the worst forms of child labor. The government did not formally extend the National Action Plan to Fight Against Trafficking in Persons, which expired in 2017. The government did not fund any social services programs during the reporting period to address the worst forms of child labor present in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, information on children's work is extremely limited because there has never been a national child labor survey or similar research conducted in the Republic of the Congo.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Cook Islands, the government made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in 2018. The government ratified ILO Convention C. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Costa Rica made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched new cooperative efforts with nongovernmental organizations to develop projects to prevent child labor as part of its Roadmap against Child Labor and the Worst Forms of Child Labor. Costa Rica also amended its Penal Code to strengthen the provisions related to child trafficking, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security collaborated with the International Labor Organization to develop a statistical tool that will identify child labor risks. Furthermore, the National Child Welfare Agency issued and trained relevant agencies on a protocol for the care of child victims, and the President signed an Executive Order authorizing the countrywide expansion of childcare centers for children of migrant farm workers. However, children in Costa Rica engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Existing social programs are insufficient to reach all child laborers, and resources for the government’s child labor law enforcement agencies remain inadequate.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Côte d’Ivoire made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed a new 2018–2020 National Action Plan of the Fight Against Trafficking, Exploitation, and Child Labor, and drafted a National Labor Inspection Strategy. The First Lady of Côte d’Ivoire signed a memorandum of understanding for carrying out applied research on child labor in cocoa-growing areas, and opened a child protection center that houses and provides education, medical care, counseling, and vocational training to victims of child labor. The government also took enforcement actions against violations of the worst forms of child labor, including sentencing a child trafficker to 3 years in prison. However, children in Côte d’Ivoire engage in the worst forms of child labor in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Gaps remain in resources, personnel, and training for law enforcement, which hindered child labor law enforcement efforts. Furthermore, the labor inspectorate is not authorized to assess penalties.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Djibouti made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the Djibouti National Police created a sub-unit to investigate child begging and forced child begging. In addition, the Anti-Trafficking Working Group improved coordination among government agencies, which resulted in more holistic protective services and investigations of potential human trafficking cases, including of children. However, children in Djibouti engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Law enforcement efforts are inadequate to prevent and combat child labor, in part because the number of labor inspectors is likely insufficient for the size of the labor force and they lack the authority to assess penalties. The government did not make adequate efforts to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor due to lack of financial and human resource allocation and reporting mechanisms. In addition, overall coordination is lacking in efforts to address all forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Dominica made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government made public its number of labor inspectors, demonstrating that the country meets the ILO's benchmark for the ratio of labor inspectors to the size of its workforce. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Dominica engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Dominica's legal framework does not protect children from exploitative work outside of the school year, and the government has not determined the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. The country also lacks prohibitions against the use of children in prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances, and the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, the Dominican Republic made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the Labor Inspectorate's budget from $3.3 million in 2017 to $4.8 million in 2018.The government also approved the 2017 - 2020 National Action Plan against Human Trafficking and Illicit Smuggling of Migrants and continued to fund and participate in multiple programs that include the goal of eliminating or preventing child labor, including expanding the Extended School Day program to cover 1.3 million students. However, children in the Dominican Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain, including limited human and financial resources for the enforcement of child labor laws, and inadequate assistance for children engaged in harmful agricultural work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Ecuador made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Assembly's Workers' Rights Committee presented legislation to reform Ecuador's Labor Code to strengthen provisions related to the eradication of child labor. The National Assembly also passed the Law to Prevent and Eradicate Violence against Women, which includes protections for girls and women who become victims of sexual exploitation. In addition, the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion signed agreements to strengthen child labor prevention efforts with local governments. The Ministry of the Interior also began drafting a new National Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons and the Ministry of Labor began drafting a 2018–2021 update to the current National Plan to Eradicate Child Labor. However, children in Ecuador engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children  also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The labor inspectorate continues to lack sufficient resources.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Egypt made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Social Solidarity provided supplemental financial support to over 1.6 million individuals to support children's school attendance. The government also supported the enrollment of 44,000 refugee children in schools and formally adopted the National Plan of Action Against the Worst Forms of Child Labor and Supporting Family and the National Strategy on Childhood and Motherhood, which also has a section on child labor. However, children in Egypt engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in quarrying limestone. The government did not publish data on the enforcement of child labor laws. In addition, programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, El Salvador made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government extended its National Action Plan for the Protection of Children and Adolescents into 2019 and modified its process for granting adolescents work permits, both with the goal of aligning laws and policies with international standards and national legislation. El Salvador also published its Annual Household Survey with data on child labor, as well as a guide highlighting efforts to combat child labor in the sugarcane industry. In addition, the government launched the local government component of its Sustainable Families Strategy in 16 municipalities and implemented an inter-agency protocol to improve coordination of services for human trafficking victims. However, children in El Salvador engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in illicit activities, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of coffee. Law enforcement agencies continue to lack sufficient resources to fully enforce child labor laws.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Although Eritrea made some efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, government officials were complicit in the use of forced child labor in agriculture and military training. The government conducted 985 labor inspections during the year and provided education services to 8,575 out-of-school children in rural and remote areas. However, Eritrea is receiving this assessment because it continued to force students in grade 12, some of whom are under the age of 18, to participate in military training elements of the government's compulsory national service program, as well as forced agricultural labor. Evidence collected suggests that the national program called Maetot, in which children engage in compulsory labor in agricultural, environmental, and hygiene-related public works projects, did not take place during the reporting period due to financial constraints preventing implementation. However, Maetot remains an integral component of the government's national service framework. The government does not make law enforcement data publicly available and national laws and regulations do not identify hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children. In addition, the government does not have a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Eswatini made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The King signed the Sexual Offenses and Domestic Violence Act, which provides new legal protections for child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Additionally, the government drafted a revised Employment Act that will expand the authority of labor inspectors and criminalize the non-state recruitment of children. During the reporting period, investigators and officers received refresher training on handling cases of child labor, including the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Eswatini engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and herding livestock. Significant gaps in the legal framework remain, including a lack of legislation regulating the labor conditions under Kuhlehla and other customary practices and a de facto compulsory education age that does not meet international standards. In addition, social programs do not adequately address child labor in the agriculture sector.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Ethiopia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Anti-Human Trafficking and Smuggling of Migrants Task Force worked with the ILO to map service providers working on migration issues in order to improve coordination and collaboration. The government also nearly quadrupled the labor inspectorate's budget from its 2017 allocation, and in collaboration with the World Bank and UNICEF, it distributed 117 million textbooks and constructed 260 primary school classrooms. However, children in Ethiopia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The law in Ethiopia does not include free basic education or a compulsory age for education, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor have also not sufficiently targeted sectors with high incidences of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Falkland Islands, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Safeguarding Children’s Board convened multiple times to discuss issues related to the safety and wellbeing of children. However, the minimum ages for work and hazardous work do not meet international standards, and the law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Fiji made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government is extending its Free Education Grant to 52 additional schools over the next 2 years. The government also made child labor a strategic priority of its labor inspectorate and allocated additional resources and conducted additional inspections as part of the effort. However, children in Fiji engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government has not approved the draft National Action Plan on the Eradication of Child Labor, the 5-Year Strategic Plan for Combating Child Labor, the National Plan of Action to Eradicate Trafficking in Persons and Child Trafficking, or the National Action Plan on the Eradication of Child Labor. In addition, the Inter-Agency Trafficking Task Force has not been active since 2012. </Description>

The government investigated 16 individuals for forced child labor and signed bilateral agreements with Benin and Togo to combat child trafficking. The Senate also approved amendments to the Penal Code that increased penalties for human trafficking. Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Gabon is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it failed to conduct worksite inspections during the reporting period. Children in Gabon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. The government also lacks prohibitions against the use of children in illicit activities and the minimum age for work provisions only apply to children in formal employment relationships,  excluding children who work in the informal sector. In addition, labor inspectors do not have the authority to assess penalties, and they lack the basic resources, such as transportation, fuel, and office supplies, necessary to conduct investigations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, The Gambia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government published detailed information related to the criminal enforcement of child labor and allocated $36,000in funding to the National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons for the 2018 fiscal year. It also provided trainings to hotel staff in support of the Code of Conduct of The Gambia Tourism Authority for the Protection of Children. However, children in The Gambia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking and forced begging. Gaps in the law remain, including that children may commence an apprenticeship in the informal sector at the age of 12, an age below the compulsory education age of 16. Although the government has adopted various policies addressing human trafficking, research also found no evidence of a policy on other worst forms of child labor. In addition, the scope of social programs is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem, as programs do not reach all children working in agriculture and domestic work, or those vulnerable to human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, and street work.        </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Georgia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed the 2018 Law on Occupational Safety to allow unannounced inspections in harmful, hazardous, and heavy industries, and carried out 90 unannounced inspections in these industries during the reporting period. The 2019 Law on Occupational Safety grants labor inspectors the ability to enter any business for occupational health and safety reasons without prior notification starting in late 2019.The government also approved a National Action Plan on Human Trafficking for 2019–2020 to protect and integrate street children through issuing identity documents and inclusive education. However, children in Georgia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including inforced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The labor inspectorate is allowed to conduct unannounced inspections only in harmful, hazardous, and heavy industries, and requires a court order to inspect all other businesses in the country. In addition, the compulsory education age leaves 15-year-old children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor, as they are not required to be in school but are not legally permitted to work full time. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Ghana made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government secured at least14 convictions for offenses related to the worst forms of child labor, approved the National Plan of Action Phase II on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, and launched a strategy to combat child labor in the fishing sector. Additionally, representatives from the government met with counterparts from Burkina Faso, Benin, and Togo to discuss coordinating efforts to combat cross-border trafficking. However, children in Ghana continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in fishing and cocoa harvesting, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Prohibitions related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. The government also has not acceded to the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and resource constraints severely limited government social protection agencies’ abilities to fully implement social programs during the reporting period.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Grenada made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Grenada, no study of child labor has been done to confirm this. The government's ability to prevent children from becoming engaged in the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition, there are insufficient prohibitions against children’s involvement in hazardous work and illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Guatemala made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, and the Public Ministry created a new regional Anti-Trafficking Unit in Quetzaltenango to improve and expedite the prosecution of trafficking cases. The government also published a functioning guide for the Departmental Committees for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor and launched 21 committees. In addition, the government reactivated its National Working Group for the Prevention and Protection of Children and Adolescents against Sexual Exploitation in Activities Related to Travel and Tourism and conducted a population and housing survey with updated data on child labor that will be published in 2019.However, children in Guatemala are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The lack of a sufficient number of labor inspectors and resources limited the Ministry of Labor and Social Security's (MTPS) ability to combat the worst forms of child labor. In addition, existing social programs are insufficient to reach all children engaged in exploitative labor and, in particular, do not target children engaged in domestic work or agriculture.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Guinea made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government organized a training course on forced labor and trafficking in conjunction with the ILO for members of the police and gendarmerie and published statistics related to the criminal enforcement of child labor laws. However, children in Guinea engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor, and corruption in law enforcement agencies and the judiciary may impede enforcement efforts. In addition, the government does not implement sufficient social programs to address the extent of the child labor problem.        </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Guinea-Bissau made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented the Code of Conduct Against Sexual Exploitation in Tourism by conducting various awareness raising campaigns on the commercial sexual exploitation of children for hotel and night club owners, and throughout Bissau and the Bijagós Archipelago. The government also hired 13 additional labor inspectors and, in conjunction with NGO partners, provided more than 150 child victims of human trafficking for forced begging with reintegration, medical assistance, and shelter. However, children in Guinea-Bissau engage in the worst forms of child labor in forced begging. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. In addition, the government has not determined the types of hazardous work prohibited for children and law enforcement officials do not receive the appropriate training and resources to adequately conduct inspections and prosecute cases of child labor. Furthermore, social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Guyana made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In August 2018, the government established, within the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission, a trafficking in persons unit responsible for registering and categorizing local and foreign workers, including children, in the hinterland. The government also approved the National Policy on Child Labor that aims to eradicate child labor by 2025, and contributed $300,000 to NGO-run shelters for human trafficking victims. However, children in Guyana continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Law enforcement agencies have insufficient financial and human resources to enforce laws related to child labor, including its worst forms, and existing laws do not fully prohibit using children in certain forms of child labor. Moreover, the government does not have targeted social programs to fully address the extent of the child labor problem in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Haiti made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government established, trained, and deployed a specialized unit of border police known as the POLIFRONT to combat transnational crime, including human trafficking. It also secured 17 convictions for crimes related to the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Haiti perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and domestic work. Children are also placed in orphanages where some are subsequently used for domestic work. Haiti lacks a clear, easily applicable minimum age for domestic work and a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. In addition, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Honduras made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Congress approved a new penal code that updates penalties for human trafficking. The Secretariat of Labor and Social Security (STSS) also released a new national strategy for its labor inspectorate, and the Inter-agency Commission against Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons obtained administrative and budget autonomy. As part of implementing its Roadmap to Eliminate Child Labor, Honduras installed a National Council for Youth and Adolescents, and the country became only the second in Central America to join the Regional Action Group for the Americas against the Sexual Exploitation of Girls, Boys and Adolescents in Tourism Travel. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it did not provide information about criminal law enforcement efforts related to the worst forms of child labor, limiting the ability to assess the adequacy of its criminal enforcement. Children in Honduras engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking and recruitment by gangs into illicit activities. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Labor and criminal law enforcement agencies experience financial and human resource challenges that may hinder adequate law enforcement. In addition, the government’s social programs that address child labor in agriculture do not appear sufficient to address the scope of the problem nationwide, and the government lacks social programs to eliminate child labor in other dangerous activities, such as fishing, mining, and domestic work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, India made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted the Trafficking of Persons (Prevent, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, which criminalizes and enhances penalties for aggravated forms of trafficking, including trafficking for the purposes of forced labor, bonded labor, and begging. It also established a new task force to implement the Child and Adolescent Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act and distributed a new data collection form that requires state governments to annually report to the National Crime Records Bureau specific details of human trafficking cases that occur at the district level. During the reporting period, police and child protection officers in several states conducted raids to rescue children from hazardous child labor and commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi issued standard operating procedures for the immediate release of financial assistance to adults and children rescued from bonded labor and drafted a policy to combat human trafficking. However, children in India engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor producing garments and quarrying stones. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of thread and yarn. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work in unsafe and unhealthy environments for long periods of time, and penalties for employing children may be insufficient to deter violations.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Indonesia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government substantially increased its labor inspectorate funding from $2.1 million in 2017 to $10.2 million with specific funds allocated to enforcing child labor regulations. It also conducted 19,792 labor inspections and continued working with the International Organization for Migration to establish a comprehensive integrated Trafficking in Persons database. However, children in Indonesia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as the result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in plantation agriculture, including in palm oil and tobacco production. The Ministry of Manpower continued to lack the financial resources and personnel necessary to adequately enforce child labor laws throughout the country. In addition, the Domestic Workers Protection Bill, which has been under consideration since 2010, continued to languish in parliament.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>  In 2018,Iraq made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament endorsed the Iraqi Law to Combat Human Trafficking. The Iraqi Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs increased the number of inspections, shut down several brick factories for violations of child labor laws, and continued its cash transfer program for at-risk children and families. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Iraq is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)authorities continued to inappropriately detain and prosecute without legal representation children allegedly affiliated to ISIS—some of whom were victims of forcible recruitment and use—and used abusive interrogation techniques and torture to gain children’s confessions; the government did not screen these children as potential human trafficking victims. In addition, in2018, some militia groups affiliated with the Popular Mobilization Forces, including Iranian-backed groups, recruited boys younger than age 18 to fight in Syria and Yemen. While these forces operated under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces—which was legally incorporated into the Iraqi defense forces in 2016—they generally remained outside of the command and control of the Iraqi government. Children in Iraq engage in other worst forms of child labor, including forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Labor law enforcement suffers from an insufficient number of labor inspectors and a lack of funding for inspections, authority to assess penalties, and labor inspector training. There is no child labor policy in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and research could not find information on the implementation of the existing policy in Iraq. The government also continues to lack programs that focus on assisting children involved in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Jamaica made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published the results of its Jamaica National Youth Activity Survey and increased its number of labor inspectors to meet recommended international enforcement standards. Jamaica also amended a key piece of legislation related to human trafficking and established the U.S.-Jamaica Child Protection Compact Partnership to combat child trafficking. However, children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and illicit activities. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, fishing, construction, domestic work, and in wholesale and retail. Jamaica's labor inspectorate lacks the authority to assess penalties for labor law violations and although the government has laws prohibiting the use of children in some illicit activities, it does not provide higher penalties for using, procuring, or offering children for the production and distribution of drugs compared to those for using adults.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Jordan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased the number of labor inspections for the second consecutive year and enrolled over130,000 Syrian refugee children in schools. In addition, the government continued to provide shelter, educational, and financial services to children engaged in child labor, including in the city of Irbid and in the Palestinian refugee camp in Marka. However, children in Jordan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in street work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Insufficient resources hampered the Ministry of Labor’s capacity to ensure compliance with child labor laws in the agricultural sector. Despite government efforts, Syrian children still face barriers to accessing education due to costs associated with transportation, school fees, and supplies, among other issues. In addition, the government did not implement sufficient social programs to fully address child labor, particularly in agriculture, construction, and street vending.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Kazakhstan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Education and Science, in cooperation with other government agencies, carried out targeted joint inspection operations in areas where child labor may occur, and the government adopted a new national action plan to counter trafficking in persons. However, children in Kazakhstan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in cotton harvesting and commercial sexual exploitation. The government lacks programs to address child labor in cotton harvesting, as well as current, comprehensive, and detailed research on child labor. The government also does not have a policy that addresses all relevant forms of child labor in the country. In addition, the complaint mechanism did not allow for anonymous individuals to report violations of labor laws, and not a single case of child labor was reported to government hotlines on children's issues.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Kenya made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government greatly increased the number of labor inspectors, inspections conducted, and child labor violations identified. However, children in Kenya engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Kenya has yet to ratify the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. In addition, the minimum age for work law does not protect children working outside the scope of a formal employment contract or in circumstances in which children derive no benefit from their labor. The government has also not committed sufficient resources to child labor enforcement. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Kiribati made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented the United Nations Pacific Strategy, which applies a strategic framework to develop and employ economic development strategies, including eliminating the worst forms of child labor. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Kiribati perform dangerous tasks in construction and street vending. Existing laws do not identify hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children, and the government has not adopted a national policy to combat the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Kosovo made a moderate advancement to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a new Criminal Code that prohibited the recruitment of children into non-state armed groups and increased penalties for producing, using, or involving children in the production, possession, or procurement of child pornography. Teachers in Prizren Municipality were also trained on identifying children at risk of being trafficked, and the Kosovo Police received child trafficking training, including on the use of children in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities. In addition, the government enacted a Children's Rights Action Plan for 2019 to 2021that aims to improve the social, economic, and legislative rights of children. However, children in Kosovo engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The labor inspectorate and Centers for Social Welfare continue to face financial and human resource constraints that may impede their ability to adequately address child labor problems. In addition, human trafficking shelters lack sufficient funding to properly accommodate and treat child trafficking victims.</Description>

However, children in the Kyrgyz Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. The government’s child trafficking laws are not in line with international standards, and research indicates that the State Inspectorate on Ecological and Technical Safety employed an insufficient number of labor inspectors. In addition, the compulsory education age remained lower than the minimum age for work.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Lebanon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education adopted the Policy for the Protection of Students in the School Environment to protect children's right to education. The government also issued a new regulation for Syrian refugee children ages 15 to 17 that improves their access to education. In addition, the President launched a children's choir to raise awareness on child labor and empower former child laborers. However, children in Lebanon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in construction and in forced labor in agriculture. Children also engage in child labor in the production of potatoes and tobacco. The Ministry of Labor’s budget was unable to cover equipment, personnel, and transport costs to conduct inspections, and labor inspectors do not have the authority to assess penalties. In addition, programs targeting child labor remained insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Lesotho made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Employment assigned labor inspectors to operate a Child Labor Desk within the ministry, and provided recommendations that supported the expansion of inspections into the informal sector. However, children in Lesotho continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in animal herding, domestic work, and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Lesotho’s compulsory education age is below the minimum age for work, leaving children in between these ages vulnerable to child labor. The government lacks sufficient mechanisms to combat child labor, and labor inspections are not conducted in high-risk sectors, including the informal sector. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Liberia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government significantly increased the number of labor inspectors from 31 to 50. In addition, the Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force collaborated with international organizations, NGOs, and high-level officials to conduct a two-month long public awareness campaign around World Day Against Trafficking. However, children in Liberia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of rubber, and the mining of gold and diamonds. The Liberia National Police’s Women and Children Protection Section and the National Commission on Child Labor continue to lack sufficient resources to conduct investigations and enforce child labor laws. The compulsory education age is also lower than the minimum age for work, making 15-year-old children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor because they are not required to attend school while also not legally permitted to work until age 16. In addition, social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem in the country, particularly where child labor is prevalent.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Madagascar made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new decree to make child labor legislation more comprehensive and approved the ratification of International Labor Organization Convention 189 on Domestic Workers and Protocol 29 of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention. The government also partnered with outside organizations to increase awareness of child labor and strengthen child labor law enforcement in isolated regions. In addition, the government continued to participate in a number of programs targeting the worst forms of child labor, including expanding a cash transfer program to benefit 65,000 households in7 regions of Madagascar. However, children in Madagascar engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of vanilla. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government failed to impose penalties for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Malawi made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government debated an amendment to the Employment Act that would prohibit tenancy farming, and passed the Tobacco Industry Bill of 2018, which requires tobacco growers to report on efforts to eliminate child labor in tobacco farming. It also finalized the National Children's Policy, which will begin implementation in 2019.In addition, government inspectors also facilitated the removal of more than1,000 victims of child labor and referred them to social services provided by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Welfare. However, children in Malawi continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the harvesting of tobacco and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as the result of human trafficking.  In addition, gaps continue to exist in labor law enforcement related to child labor, including financial resource allocation.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Maldives made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Maldives Police Service conducted awareness-raising programs for 36 guesthouse operators and resort managers on protecting children from commercial sexual exploitation within the tourism industry. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Maldives engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government has not determined specific hazardous occupations or activities that are prohibited for children, and the law does not sufficiently prohibit commercial sexual exploitation of children. Moreover, the government does not have a coordinating mechanism, policy, or program that addresses all relevant worst forms of child labor in the country.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Mali made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government finalized the National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking of Persons and allocated a budget of $10 million over 5 years for implementation. The government also convicted1 perpetrator for attempting to traffic3 children to Cote d'Ivoire and provided services to 53 victims of child soldiering, of which 21 were reunited with their families. Finally, under the National Policy for Promotion and Protection of Children, the government conducted activities to increase birth registration. However, children in Mali engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in the production of cotton and rice. Mali's law does not comprehensively prohibit hereditary slavery in cases where recruitment, transport, transfer, harboring, or receipt of a person is not involved nor does the law explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities. In addition, resource constraints severely limited the government’s ability to fully implement the National Plan to Combat Child Labor, and existing social programs are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem, particularly in artisanal gold mining, hereditary slavery, and debt bondage.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Mauritania made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government approved a new General Child Protection Code that expanded the number of hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children, increased penalties to deter violations, and established birth registration as a right and duty. The government also established a National Council for Child Protection and allocated a budget of $100,000 to manage social centers for vulnerable children, including talibés. Despite these new initiatives to address child labor, Mauritania is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice and policy that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, criminal law enforcement authorities did not make adequate efforts to combat slavery and its vestiges. Specifically, the government did not adequately prosecute or secure convictions in slavery cases, and reports continue to indicate that some government actors, including police and judicial authorities, are unwilling to pursue such cases. In addition, since 2011, the government has required proof of marriage and biological parents’ citizenship for children to obtain a birth certificate. As a result, children born out of wedlock and many Haratine and sub-Saharan ethnic minority children, including those of slave descent, have been prevented from being registered at birth. Because birth certificates are required for enrollment in secondary school in Mauritania, children as young as age 12 cannot access education, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mauritania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary slavery. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in herding cattle and goats. The government did not make sufficient efforts to raise awareness of laws that prohibit slavery and enforce some laws related to the worst forms of child labor, including on hereditary slavery and forced begging. In addition, lack of financial resources severely limited the relevant government agencies’ ability to fully implement policies, and social programs to combat the worst forms of child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Mauritius made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented a National Sports Policy that created a structured after-school program for children. It also increased its labor inspections by200percent and approved a Special Education Needs Bill, which will reduce barriers to education for children with special needs. However, children in Mauritius engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in construction, vending, and working in apparel shops and restaurants. The government lacks a national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. The Coordinating Committee on Child Labor, established in 2017, is no longer active and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Law and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Moldova made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed Government Decree No. 378 to grant financial allowances to children left without parental care until they reach the age of 18. Labor inspectors also attended regional anti-trafficking workshops, including a policy planning workshop organized by the Permanent Secretariat for the National Committee for Combating Trafficking in Person and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Moldova is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because of a regression in law and practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In August 2018, the government amended Law No.131through Law No. 179, indicating that the State Labor Inspectorate does not have legal authority to conduct on-site inspections without at least first requesting and receiving insufficient documentation from the business being inspected or conducting a risk assessment that finds reasonable indicators of a possible violation. The amendments to Law No. 131 allow announced on-site inspections only if the State Labor Inspectorate gives the business owner five day's notice that the inspection will be conducted within ten business days. Unannounced inspections, even those based on a complaint, including at the request of law enforcement or other state bodies, are permitted only based on a risk assessment that indicates an immediate threat to the environment, life, health, or property. These stringent new measures have been interpreted by the State Labor Inspectorate as stripping the body of its ability to conduct unannounced on-site inspections. Other stakeholders maintain that unannounced inspections are still possible when required conditions are met. In addition, when any inspection is conducted, the labor inspector must now only focus on the alleged violation outlined in the complaint; if other violations, such as child labor, are uncovered, they cannot be addressed. Children in Moldova engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Moldova lacks a sufficient number of labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce. In addition, training is needed for new investigators and, due to government restructuring, no occupational health and safety inspections, including of hazardous child labor, were conducted during the reporting period.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Mongolia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government conducted two major surveys on child labor and protection issues. In addition, the Family, Child, and Youth Development Agency, the General Agency for Specialized Investigation, and the ILO conducted a joint training on preventing child and forced labor for 64 child rights officers and labor inspectors. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mongolia is receiving this assessment because the government did not permit the labor inspectorate to conduct unannounced inspections, which may have impeded the enforcement of child labor laws. Children in Mongolia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining and horse jockeying. Mongolia continues to have a number of legal statutes that do not meet international standards for the protection of children.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Montenegro made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Interior's Beggar Task Force investigated 246 people, out of which 33 were juveniles, and 22 children were sent to Social Welfare Centers. Labor inspectors also received trainings on forced child labor and informal work from the Ministry of Interior’s Office for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons and the ILO. In addition, the Supreme State Prosecutor and Police Director adopted a decision to establish a Counter Human Trafficking Task Force, and the government passed the Strategy for Inclusive Education, which aims to provide education to all children in the country, including children with disabilities. Moreover, the Shelter for Victims of Human Trafficking, Forced Begging, and Forced Marriages helped four minors in 2018. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government did not secure convictions related to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Montenegro engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, research found that the scope of programs to address child labor in street work or forced begging is insufficient.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Montserrat, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018.During the reporting period, the Labor Office used media programming to inform children and adults of the legal age to work in the country. However, the government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Morocco made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published information on criminal and labor law enforcement efforts, in addition to investigating and prosecuting criminal cases involving child labor violations. Moreover, it operated child protection centers and continued to fund the Tayssir Conditional Cash Transfer Program, providing direct cash transfers to qualifying families whose children meet school attendance criteria, reaching more than 2 million students in 2018. The government also launched social programs focused on providing vocational training to at-risk youth, and assistance to street children at risk of child labor. In addition, it drafted legislation to enhance enforcement abilities in the artisanal sector, specifically allowing labor inspectors to enter into private workshops employing any number of employees. However, children in Morocco engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work. Children also engage in child labor in producing artisanal handicrafts. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. The scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Mozambique made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Law on the National System of Education, raising the compulsory education age to 15. The government also drafted a revision to the Labor Law establishing 15 as the minimum age for work and eliminating the exception that allows children as young as age 12 to work. Furthermore, the Attorney General's Office significantly increased its training capacity and expanded training for law enforcement officers, including a series of workshops for journalists focusing on victim identification and reporting methods that ensure victim safety and improve the government's ability to prosecute human trafficking cases. However, children in Mozambique engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of tobacco. Labor inspectors do not receive sufficient training, and the government lacks both the appropriate resources to enforce child labor laws and a coordination mechanism to address child labor. In addition, existing programs are insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem in Mozambique.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Namibia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed the Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act and approved the National Referral Mechanism that directs first-line response teams on how to detect and provide services to victims of trafficking. In addition, it also provided substantive training for law enforcement pertaining to child protection, including child labor. However, children in Namibia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in domestic work and street work. Hazardous work prohibitions for children in the services sector are not comprehensive. In addition, social programs do not address child labor in agriculture. </Description>

        <Description>  In 2018, Nepal made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Nepal Labor Force Survey, which will be able to provide valuable information on child labor, including the number of children engaged in hazardous work. It also drafted revisions to the Child Labor Act of 2002, with the aim of raising the minimum age to 18 for entry into hazardous work and ensuring that the list of hazardous work for children is comprehensive. In addition, the government created a new National Child Labor Elimination Committee to coordinate efforts to address child labor and passed the new National Master Plan to End Child Labor, which prioritizes ending the worst forms of child labor by 2022, and all forms of child labor by 2025. Moreover, the government launched a Decent Work Country Program and the Social Security Fund Program to support workers and their families and combat child labor. However, children in Nepal engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of bricks. The Department of Labor’s budget, the number of labor inspectors, and available resources and training are all insufficient for enforcing labor laws, including those related to child labor. Furthermore, children age 17 are excluded from the protections of the country’s hazardous work list, leaving them vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Nicaragua made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government released its National Action Plan against Human Trafficking and provided trainings to government officials on identifying and caring for victims of human trafficking. However, children in Nicaragua engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. National policies to eliminate child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented, and the government lacks a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor. In addition, the government does not dedicate sufficient resources to child labor law enforcement and does not publish complete criminal law enforcement data on child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Niger made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Supreme Court set a legal precedent banning the practice of wahaya, a form of slavery in Niger in which men buy girls born into slavery, typically between ages 9 and 11, as “fifth wives. "The government also adopted a law to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, including children, to prevent their exploitation in the worst forms of child labor. More than300 judges, magistrates, and law enforcement officials received training on investigating and prosecuting trafficking in persons cases, and government officials participated in a regional workshop to reinforce counter-trafficking coordination among member countries of the Economic Community of West African States. In addition, the government continued to educate religious leaders on how to combat the worst forms of child labor and implemented several other programs to address the worst forms of child labor, including a program that aims to combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling. However, children in Niger engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, existing child labor laws and regulations do not apply to children in unpaid or non-contractual work. Gaps in labor law enforcement, such as funding to conduct labor inspections, have also left children unprotected from the worst forms of child labor. In addition, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Nigeria made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted the Edo State Trafficking in Persons Prohibition Law, which codified the Edo State Taskforce for implementation. Nigeria's National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons received $715,100 for victim care in 2018, a three-fold increase over its 2017 allocation, and government officials appropriated $3.8 million to provide training and education materials to raise awareness among youth of the dangers of human trafficking. Criminal investigators also conducted 314 investigations into the worst forms of child labor, resulting in 5 convictions.  Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, Nigeria's security forces continued to detain children for prolonged periods of time due to their alleged association with Boko Haram, including girls who were used as concubines. Children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in quarrying granite and gravel, commercial sexual exploitation, and armed conflict. Other gaps remain, including inconsistencies regarding child labor in the legal framework, and the minimum age for work is below international standards. Furthermore, there are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce, and social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Niue, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in 2018.The government implemented the United Nations Pacific Strategy, which includes economic development strategies, including eliminating child labor and the worst forms of child labor. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Niue has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, North Macedonia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Labor Relations Act to prohibit children under the age of 15 or those who have not completed compulsory education from working, except under limited circumstances. Additionally, funding was sufficient for both labor and criminal law enforcement to combat child labor, and the National Coordination Body for Protection of Children from Abuse and Neglect was reconstituted. However, children in North Macedonia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. The law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships. In addition, labor inspectors are unevenly distributed across the country, causing some businesses to be inspected more than others.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Oman made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Sultan of Oman promulgated a new Penal Code that enhanced penalties related to commercial sexual exploitation of children. The National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking signed an agreement with the Oman Lawyers Association to allow attorneys to represent victims of human trafficking on a pro bono basis. The Committee also launched and began implementing a new National Action Plan for Combating Human Trafficking and conducted awareness-raising activities. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Oman engage in child labor, including in fishing and selling items in kiosks. The government lacks a reciprocal referral mechanism between the labor inspectorate and social services.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Pakistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. All four provincial governments started conducting child labor surveys, which will constitute the first nationwide child labor survey since 1996. The federal government also passed the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act and convicted its first child pornography case. In addition, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh provinces each adopted new policies that will address child labor. However, children in Pakistan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and in bonded labor in brick kilns and agriculture. Although the federal and provincial governments made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the federal government and Balochistan Province have not established a minimum age for work or hazardous work in compliance with international standards. In addition, provincial governments do not have the resources necessary to adequately enforce laws prohibiting child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Panama made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted modifications to its hazardous work regulations, significantly increased its number of labor inspectors, and established a Regional Headquarters in Cocle to target child labor in areas outside the capital city. It also launched a national initiative to prevent violence against children, which includes the goal of eliminating child labor, and conducted a new study on child work, child labor, and the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Panama engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, Panamanian law allows minors under age 16 to engage in hazardous work within training establishments, in violation of international standards. Moreover, the Labor Inspectorate lacks the authority to collect fines for labor violations, limiting its capacity to enforce laws on the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Papua New Guinea made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Department of Community Development, Youth, and Religion distributed the first Child Care Center licenses, which are centers that provide a safe location for children removed by Child Protection Officers from situations deemed to be harmful to their health and safety. However, children in Papua New Guinea engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Papua New Guinea's laws do not specifically define the hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children, nor do they prohibit using, procuring, or offering a child for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Furthermore, insufficient resources hamper the labor inspectorate’s capacity to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Paraguay made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Recently elected President Mario Abdo Benitez and the Paraguayan Congress upgraded the Secretariat of Adolescents and Children to a full ministry-level body, which allows greater access to high-level political decisions and its own budget. The Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security also opened a new regional office in Filadelfia (Chaco region), and the Ministry of Women's Affairs conducted training on human trafficking and avoiding victimization for 1,500 individuals in at-risk communities and high-risk industries. In addition, the National Commission to Prevent and Eradicate the Exploitation of Children updated its action plan for the 2018–2020 period and the government updated the National Strategy for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor and Protection of Working Adolescents for the 2018–2023 period. However, children in Paraguay are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in debt bondage in cattle raising, as well as domestic servitude, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Limited funding for law enforcement agencies and social programs hampered the government’s ability to fully address the worst forms of child labor, particularly in rural areas.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Peru made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Labor Inspection Superintendency opened two new inspection offices and added approximately $14 million to its 2018 budget. Peru's Congress also passed legislation to strengthen the labor inspectorate system by temporarily transferring competencies, functions, and staff from the Regional Governments to the National Labor Inspection Superintendency. In addition, the government renewed the National Plan to Combat Forced Labor and the National Policy Against Trafficking in Persons. However, children in Peru engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Peruvian law allows children ages 12 to 14 to do light work without specifying the activities in which children may work. In addition, labor law enforcement agencies in Peru lack sufficient inspectors and training to effectively combat child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, the Philippines made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government commenced a nationwide profiling of child laborers and issued Administrative Order No. 142-18, Guidelines on the Profiling of Child Laborers and Provision of Service to Remove Them from Child Labor, to harmonize the process of removing children from child labor and referring them to appropriate services. It permanently closed down a motel that was found to engage children in prostitution and obscene shows, and approved the Guidelines on the Management of Compensation for Victim-Survivors of Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children. However, children in the Philippines engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and gold mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government did not adequately protect children engaged in drug trafficking from inappropriate incarceration, penalties, or physical harm. In addition, the enforcement of child labor laws remains challenging, especially due to the limited number of inspectors, lack of resources for inspections, and inspectors’ inability to assess penalties. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Rwanda made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted several new laws to strengthen protections for children, including a revised Labor Law, a comprehensive anti-trafficking law, a law imposing heightened penalties for the use of children in armed conflict or illicit activities, and the Law on Child Protection that supplements the existing 2012 law. The government also established the Rwanda Investigation Bureau, which conducts investigations into criminal matters, including child labor, and actively partnered with the United States Agency for International Development and the International Organization for Migration to conduct a research study on human trafficking trends in Rwanda. In addition, the government obtained one conviction in a child trafficking case and launched a 5-year advocacy campaign against child labor. However, children in Rwanda engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The number of labor inspectors does not meet the ILO's technical advice for the size of the workforce. In addition, resource constraints limited some government efforts to combat child labor, and social programs did not address all relevant sectors where child labor was present.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha (formerly Saint Helena), the government made a moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018. The government passed a bill to restrict child labor and improved services for vulnerable children. However, the government has yet to define by law or regulation the types of work prohibited to children, other than work on vessels engaged in maritime navigation. Gaps also remain in legislation related to forced child labor and the trafficking of children for labor exploitation.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Saint Lucia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Computer Misuse Act to criminalize the possession of child pornography. It also established a new agency to oversee adoption, child care, and protection of children and published the National Child Protection Action Plan Report. A rapid assessment conducted by the ILO in 2016 revealed limited evidence that children in Saint Lucia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and the sale and transportation of drugs. Saint Lucia's law does not fully protect children from hazardous work and illicit activities. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased the budget for the labor inspectorate and the number of labor inspectors. The government also trained criminal law enforcement personnel on child labor and human trafficking. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Limited research also suggests that children perform dangerous tasks in begging. Gaps remain in the legal framework, as the minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards and there is no law to prohibit the use of children in the production of drugs.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Samoa made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government  issued a public notice clarifying the list of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the government established the Government Grant to Mission and Public Schools to provide financial assistance to low-income students as a continuation of the current School Fee Grant Scheme. However, children in Samoa engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street vending. Research found no evidence of laws that ban using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. The government also lacks a mechanism to coordinate interagency efforts to address child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Senegal made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a second phase of Retrait de la Rue, a program to remove children engaged in forced begging in the Dakar area, with some success. The government also revised a2005 anti-trafficking in persons law with an aim to widen its use by prosecutors. The government published additional information related to labor law enforcement. However, children in Senegal engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Criminal and labor law enforcement agencies lack adequate resources to carry out their work, and an overlap of mandated activities among the coordinating bodies creates confusion and obstructs effective collaboration and enforcement. Furthermore, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children do not include domestic work and street work, areas where there is evidence of child involvement.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Serbia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted the Law on the Rights of the Child and Protection of Child Rights and launched a RoadMap for Eliminating Abuse of Child Labor in Serbia. The Council for Children's Rights drafted a Strategy for Protection of Children from Violence and the Ministry of Interior developed Standard Operating Procedures for Human Trafficking Victims Protections. In addition, the government provided cash transfers to 380,000 vulnerable families with children, and applied penalties in 25 criminal cases related to child labor. However, children in Serbia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Serbia's laws do not treat child beggars as victims and Serbia's social welfare centers are over burdened, which limits efforts to combat  child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Sierra Leone made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. President Bio and Vice President Jalloh together with officials from ministries, departments, and agencies, donated3 months of their salaries to eliminate school fees for more than2 million students in primary and secondary education. International donors provided the bulk of funding support to implement the government's free quality education program. Despite this initiative, Sierra Leone is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement a policy that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The government continued to prohibit girls who were pregnant from attending regular public schools or taking secondary and post-secondary school entrance exams during the reporting period, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Sierra Leone engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the mining sector and in commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and quarrying. The country has not implemented its national action plan on child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, the Solomon Islands made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Anti-Human Trafficking Advisory Committee became an authorized organization to lobby and influence the government on trafficking-related issues, including child trafficking. However, children in the Solomon Islands engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The minimum age for employment does not meet international standards, and the government has not comprehensively identified the hazardous occupations prohibited for children. In addition, education is not compulsory, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor exploitation.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practices that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Somalia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government drafted a National Employment Policy and an updated Labor Code that identify hazardous occupations or activities prohibited by children. Additionally, government forces rescued 32 children who had been kidnapped by al-Shabaab. However, despite these initiatives, Somalia is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement practices that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The Somali National Army recruited and used children in armed conflict in violation of its national law during the reporting period. Somalia is also receiving this assessment because it lacks a labor inspectorate and conducted no worksite labor inspections. Children in Somalia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. Children in Somalia also perform dangerous tasks in street work. In addition, laws do not criminally prohibit child trafficking for labor, commercial sexual exploitation, or the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, South Africa made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The President endorsed and disseminated the amended Children’s Act to prohibit persons convicted of child trafficking from working with children. The government also approved the National Policy Framework on Trafficking, which includes provisions on trafficking of minors. However, children in South Africa engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging, sometimes the result of human trafficking. Labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties, and social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor. In addition, barriers to education remain, especially among children without proper identification documents and children with disabilities.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, South Sudan is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Although South Sudan made some efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, government officials were complicit in the forcible recruitment of children to fight opposition groups. The government acceded to the UN CRC Optional Protocols on Armed Conflict and Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and signed the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. The South Sudan Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Commission also secured the release of 934 children from armed groups and launched several new policies, which may have an impact on child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, South Sudanis receiving an assessment of no advancement because its national army—the South Sudan People’s Defense Forces—recruited children, sometimes forcibly, to fight opposition groups. Children in South Sudan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict and cattle herding. The labor inspectorate also does not have sufficient resources to conduct labor inspections and did not hold accountable perpetrators of child labor. In addition, the government has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and police continued to indiscriminately arrest and imprison children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation rather than treating them as victims.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Sri Lanka made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government worked with the ILO to develop guidelines for establishing child labor free zones and trained government officials to implement this program. In addition, the National Child Protection Authority trained 2,770 criminal law enforcement officials on the prevention of the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Sri Lanka engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. The hazardous work list is not comprehensive because it does not include domestic work. In addition, the labor inspectorate is not authorized to assess penalties.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Suriname made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified International Labor Organization Convention 138 concerning the minimum age for admission to employment, acceded to the Protocol to the Forced Labor Convention, and amended the Law on Labor for Children and Young People, raising the minimum age of work to 16 years. In addition, the Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons presented the 2019 National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons, the government published the results of the 2017 Child Labor Survey and created a referral mechanism between criminal law enforcement authorities and social services. However, children in Suriname engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. In addition, the compulsory education age does not reach the minimum age for employment, leaving some children more vulnerable to labor exploitation. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, São Tomé and Príncipe made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new Labor Law, which includes a list of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the new Basic Education System Law was adopted, increasing the compulsory education age to 15 years. The government also continued to contribute resources to support centers that aim to prevent child labor by keeping children in school. However, children in São Tomé and Príncipe engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Limited financial resources hamper law enforcement agencies' capacity to enforce child labor laws. The National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor was not implemented due to lack of funding, and programs targeting children engaged in agriculture are lacking.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, The United Republic of Tanzania made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government made efforts by establishing a new National Child Labor Policy and continuing to support the Tanzania Social Action Fund Conditional Cash Transfer Program, planning Phase IV for launch in 2019.However, despite these initiatives to address child labor, Tanzania continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The Mainland Government explicitly supports the routine expulsion of pregnant students from public schools, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Tanzania engage in the worst forms of child Iabor, including in mining, quarrying, and domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain in the legal framework and enforcement of laws related to child labor, including protections for child engagement in illicit activities and domestic work; the lack of authorization for the labor inspectorate to assess penalties; and the likely insufficient number of labor inspectors for the size of Tanzania’s labor force.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Thailand made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its Labor Inspectorate budget by 47 percent and allocated more resources to inspect high-risk workplaces. The rate of access to education and enrollment for migrant children has improved. The government also supported a training for 7,255 labor volunteers on the worst forms of child labor. The government hired 394 additional labor inspectors, including Department of Labor Protection and Welfare civil servants and other government employees,and22 additional interpreters at Department of Labor Protection and Welfare offices and fishing port inspection centers. The government continued the information-sharing agreement with the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to combat online child commercial sexual exploitation. Finally, the government continued to work directly with NGOs to open two additional Child Advocacy Centers, bringing the total to five in Thailand. Children in Thailand engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in Muay Thai fighting competitions without protective equipment. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet the international standard for the minimum age of work. Enforcement of child labor laws remains a challenge due to an insufficient number of inspectors.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Timor-Leste made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Prime Minister's Office convened different agencies to develop an implementation plan for the National Action Plan Against Human Trafficking via the Inter-Agency Trafficking Working Group. However, children in Timor-Leste engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Timor-Leste does not meet international standards related to the minimum age for work. In addition, Timor-Leste’s Penal Code and Labor Code only protect children under the age of 17,leaving children age 17 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Also, during most of the reporting year, the Government of Timor-Leste did not have an operating budget, which inhibited its ability to fund programs. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Togo made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government added a toll-free texting platform to its Allo 1011 hotline and made data available in real time through an online platform that is disaggregated by type. In addition, it signed a bilateral agreement with the Government of Gabon to increase cooperation in combating trafficking in persons and, with the support of the World Bank, provided 5.7 million school meals and constructed 80 new primary schools. However, children in Togo engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. The government has not devoted sufficient resources to combat child labor, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties for child labor violations. In addition, the government does not collect and publish data related to its efforts to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

        <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Tokelau, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018.The government implemented the United Nations Pacific Strategy, which includes economic development strategies, including eliminating child labor and the worst forms of child labor. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor, as the law does not criminally prohibit forced labor and child trafficking. In addition, Tokelau has not established a minimum age for work and does not prohibit hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018, Tonga made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a labor law complaint mechanism, and it is currently in the process of ratifying the ILO Convention concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment (C. 138)and the ILO Convention concerning the Worst Forms of Child Labor (C. 182). However, despite new initiative to address child labor, Tonga is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Research indicates the labor inspectorate failed to conduct any worksite inspections for the second year in a row. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Additionally, the government has not ratified ILO C. 182. Children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and fishing. Gaps in the legal framework also remain; the country has no laws specifying a minimum age for work or defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation. In addition, the government has not established a policy or program to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Tunisia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed an expanded hazardous work list that includes additional categories deemed hazardous for children, including street work. The Minister of Social Affairs has already approved this revision, which will take effect once published in the official register. As part of its Child Labor National Action Plan, the government also published full results of the 2017 National Child Labor Survey. Regarding enforcement, the government, in tandem with international organizations, conducted trainings for civil and criminal law enforcement officials on human trafficking legal statutes. It also promulgated a new National Strategy on Trafficking in Persons. Lastly, the government inaugurated the Amali Center outside of Tunis as the first facility for child victims of trafficking in persons. However, children in Tunisia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including scavenging for garbage and inforced labor in domestic work and begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. In addition, the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are engaged in work in the informal sector on inhabited premises, such as private homes, without permission of the property owner or a court order.</Description>

        <Description>  In 2018, Turkey made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government signed a Joint Declaration on the Elimination of Child Labor, declaring 2018 as the Year of Elimination of Child Labor. In addition, 355 labor inspectors,81 provincial directors, and 320teacherswere trained on child labor. The Integrated Model for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Seasonal Agriculture in Hazelnut Harvesting prevented 1,022 children from working in hazelnut harvesting and was extended to 2020.However, children in Turkey engage in the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation and recruitment by non-state armed groups. Children also perform dangerous tasks in seasonal agriculture and in small and medium manufacturing enterprises. Uneven enforcement resulted in insufficient protection of children employed in child labor. In addition, prohibition of compulsory recruitment of children by non-state armed groups does not meet international standards.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Tuvalu made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government made efforts by doubling the number of labor inspectors from the previous year from two to four. Additionally, the government passed the Labour and Employment Relations Act which prohibits the worst forms of child labor, and it has continued conducting consultations throughout the country on the proposed Child Protection and Welfare law. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Tuvalu engage in child labor in fishing and domestic work. The government has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Tuvalu lacks data to determine the prevalence and nature of child labor in the country. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Uganda made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development, in partnership with the Kampala Capital City Authority, removed 283 children from the streets of Kampala and provided them with social services. The government initiated proceedings to harmonize legal provisions on minimum age to align with international standards. It also drafted a National Action Plan on Child Labor, which was approved in February 2019. However, children in Uganda engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. The lack of a centralized supervisory authority, as well as inadequate funding, training, and resources, hampered the capacity of law enforcement agencies to conduct child labor inspections and investigations. Gaps in the legal framework persist, including contradicting laws regulating the minimum age for employment. In addition, existing programs are inadequate to address child labor in the country.</Description>

        <Description>  In 2018, Ukraine made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Ukraine officially ended the moratorium on labor inspections in February 2018. In addition, Ukraine doubled the number of labor inspectors, trained new inspectors, and established an Inter-Ministerial Counter-Trafficking Coordination Council. However, children in Ukraine engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of pornography. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. National policies related to child labor continue to lack sufficient funding for adequate implementation. Furthermore, Russian aggression in the east of the country continued, which negatively impacted the government’s ability to address the worst forms of child labor by limiting the budget available for social services and other domestic policy priorities, and increased the vulnerability to exploitation of children living in Russian-controlled geographical areas.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Uzbekistan made moderate efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government took active measures to prevent the use of forced child labor in the cotton harvest, including by issuing temporary regulations for labor conditions in organized cotton picking, reiterating the legal bans on using forced labor or child labor, raising the price paid to farmers for cotton and the wages paid to pickers, and sanctioning 169 officials for using forced labor. However, children in Uzbekistan still engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in scrap metal collection. Laws prohibiting the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards. The government also did not disaggregate criminal law enforcement data for forced labor cases to clarify which cases, if any, involved the worst forms of child labor. In addition, there are gaps in labor law enforcement, such as the decision by the government-sponsored Coordination Council on Child Labor and Forced Labor not to conduct its own harvest monitoring and an insufficient number of labor inspectors to cover the workforce adequately.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Vanuatu made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government reactivated the National Child Protection Working Group, which had been inactive since 2014. The Ambae volcano erupted in July, which forced more than 10,000 residents to relocate to neighboring islands. Children experienced long interruptions to their education and may be more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor due to the eruption and subsequent evacuations. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Vanuatu engage in dangerous tasks in forestry. Vanuatu’s minimum ages of 14 for work and 15 for hazardous work do not comply with international standards. In addition, the government did not respond to requests for information related to labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcement efforts related to eliminating child labor. Also, Vanuatu lacks a referral mechanism for criminal authorities to refer cases to social services for children.</Description>

        <Description>For the 2018 reporting period, no assessment has been made regarding Wallis and Futuna’s efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because there is no evidence of a child labor problem in Wallis and Futuna. In addition, the country has a good legal and enforcement framework on child labor.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, the Palestinian Authority made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the areas of the West Bank under its control. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education improved training for teachers and began building more classrooms and equipping them with digital facilities to improve learning at schools. The Palestinian Authority also cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to provide educational services to 280,000 students and emergency school supplies to more than 14,700 students. However, children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in construction and illicit activities. Children also engage in child labor in street vending. The legal framework does not criminally prohibit all elements of child trafficking, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties. In addition, programs to prevent or eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Morocco made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kingdom of Morocco claims the territory of Western Sahara and administers the area that it controls by the same constitution, laws, and structures as in internationally-recognized Morocco, including laws that deal with child labor. The government published information on criminal and labor law enforcement efforts, in addition to investigating and prosecuting criminal cases. Moreover, it continued to fund the Tayssir Conditional Cash Transfer Program, providing direct cash transfers to qualifying families whose children meet school attendance criteria, reaching more than 2 million students across both Morocco and Western Saharain 2018. Limited research indicates that there is some evidence that children in Western Sahara engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. In addition, research could not determine whether penalties were imposed for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. The scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

        <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
        <Description>In 2018,Yemen made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Republic of Yemen Government participated in UNICEF programs that provided educational and social services. However, despite initiatives to address child labor, Yemen is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement practices that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The government did not make efforts to combat chattel slavery by investigating and prosecuting cases, and it failed to make efforts to address discrimination in schools against children from the Muhamasheen community, leading to their increased vulnerability to child labor. Furthermore, there is evidence of recruitment and use of children in hostilities by state armed forces in contravention of Yemeni law. Children in Yemen engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and armed conflict. Children also engage in child labor in fishing. Due to the ongoing armed conflict, the internationally recognized Republic of Yemen Government worked to operationalize government ministries in its temporary capital, Aden, but was unable to provide sufficient demobilization and rehabilitation services to children who have been recruited and used by various groups engaged in armed conflict, or who have engaged in other worst forms of child labor. The rebel Houthi movement that controls a significant amount of territory in Yemen, including the occupation of Yemen’s capital city, Sana’a, made no effort to address child labor concerns in areas under their control, and would not allow researchers access to survey the population on child labor indicators.</Description>

The government developed national action plans on Child Labor and Anti-Human Trafficking in line with Zambia's 7thNational Development Plan. It also increased the number of inspectors, significantly increased the number of labor inspections conducted, identified 511child labor law violations, and achieved 5 convictions for the crime of child trafficking. In addition, the government published studies that provide insights into child labor and child commercial sexual exploitation and included child labor for the first time in its Labor Force Survey. However, children in Zambia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. The Education Act does not specify a compulsory education age, and human trafficking laws are discordant with international standards because they require threats, the use of force, or coercion to be established for the crime of child trafficking. In addition, labor inspectors lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws. </Description>

        <Description>In 2018, Zimbabwe made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government continued to implement the Trafficking in Persons Action Plan, developed a national referral mechanism to assist victims of human trafficking, and established guidelines to improve coordination of anti-trafficking efforts. In addition, it increased budget allocations for the Basic Education Assistance Module and Harmonized Social Cash Transfer programs with the aim of reaching 500,000 vulnerable children and 60,000households, respectively. However, children continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, mining, and tobacco production. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Law enforcement agencies lack resources to enforce child labor laws. In addition, gaps remain in the country’s legal framework against child labor, such as the lack of free basic education, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor.</Description>
