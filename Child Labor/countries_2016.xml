    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Afghanistan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government opened its first rehabilitation center for children previously engaged in armed conflict and provided services to 34 children. It also opened child protection units in all 34 provinces, which helped prevent the recruitment of 364 children into the Afghan National Police. The Child Protection Action Network provided educational and social services to at-risk internally displaced families and removed 50 children from mines where they engaged in child labor and enrolled them in schools. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the government was also complicit in the use of forced child labor. Afghanistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because government officials, particularly officers of the Afghan Local Police, are complicit in the practice of bacha bazi and, unlike in previous years, did not make meaningful efforts to address this crime during the reporting period. Afghan Local Police officers and members of the military continued to recruit children for the purpose of bacha baziand, inone case, police sexually assaulted a boy who sought police assistance to report his exploitation in bacha bazi. The government lacked the political will to enforce laws prohibiting bacha bazi and, despite receiving more than 63 cases of bacha bazi among Afghan military and police during the year, initiated no prosecutions and achieved no convictions. Children in Afghanistan also engage in other worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict and forced labor in the production of bricks. Afghanistan’s Labor Inspectorate is not authorized to impose penalties for child labor violations, and the government lacks sufficient programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Albania made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted the Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 91, which establishes rules and procedures to follow when a child's rights have been violated and strengthens the role of the State Agency for Rights and Protection of Children. Moreover, it adopted the Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 353 to regulate the functioning of the inter-sectorial technical group to effectively address child protection needs. The government increased the number of Child Protection Units, trained police officers on countering child trafficking, and volunteered to be a Pathfinder Country for Alliance 8.7 in order to expedite the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals related to eliminating child labor and human trafficking by 2025. However, children in Albania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and mining chromium. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the law does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities. In addition, the Labor Inspectorate needs to be strengthened to conduct effective inspections in all sectors in which child labor is known to occur.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Algeria made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In addition to conducting routine labor inspections, the government conducted a dedicated period of inspections focused solely on child labor, and achieved 98 convictions. The National Committee for the Prevention of and Fight Against Trafficking held six public events to raise awareness on human trafficking and training sessions for law enforcement and judicial personnel. The government also altered policy regarding labor law enforcement, allowing labor inspectors to assess penalties. However, children in Algeria engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The government has not sufficiently prohibited the use of children in illicit activities or determined by national law or regulation the types of work that are hazardous for children to perform. Furthermore, the government's number of labor inspectors is not in accordance with the ILO's technical advice to ensure that child labor laws are enforced in all geographic areas.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Angola made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the Penal Code, which prohibits the use of children for the production of pornography and pornographic performances. The government also approved a National Action Plan to Combat Child Labor, which aims to eliminate child labor by strengthening the rights of children, including increasing their access to education, and stipulating zoning areas and types of child labor found throughout the country to better inform policies and programs. In addition, the government deployed the Southern African Development Community Trafficking in Persons regional database, which collects national data in order to facilitate development and implementation of policies and programs to combat human trafficking. However, children in Angola engage in forced labor in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. The gap between the compulsory education age and minimum age for work leaves children ages 12 and 13 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. There are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce, and social programs do not target all sectors in which children work. In addition, implementation of existing policies is hindered by lack of financial resources.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Anguilla, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018. During the reporting, the government worked with the United Kingdom's Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service to develop a National Social Protection Policy and Action Plan and provided awareness raining, school programs, training, and workshops on child protection. However, the law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities and the minimum age for work does not meet international standards.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Argentina made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The new Secretariat of Labor worked with Argentina's National Institute of Statistics and Census to publish the country's first ever nationally representative child labor survey. Provincial courts also rendered the first ever criminal conviction for child labor in Argentina. In July 2018, the government approved the 2018-2020 Action Plan against Human Trafficking and Exploitation. In addition, the Secretariat and Special Prosecutor for Human Trafficking published guides for investigators and justice sector officials in understanding and applying Argentina's human trafficking and child labor legislation. However, children in Argentina engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities such as the transportation and sale of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government does not publish federal and provincial labor and criminal law enforcement data on child labor, and social programs that address child labor in agriculture do not appear to address the full scope of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Armenia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new program to protect children's rights. In addition, it continued to pursue labor inspection reform, including establishing the Health and Labor Inspection Body; this body, however, will have limited ability to monitor prohibitions on hazardous child labor. Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Armenia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because the government has lacked a functioning Labor Inspectorate since the 2014 repeal of Article 34 of the Labor Code, which previously established the government's authority to conduct routine labor inspections. Since that time, the government has lacked a functioning labor inspection mechanism to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws, including a mechanism with the authority to conduct unannounced inspections. Children in Armenia perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and an increasing number of children are engaged in begging and heavy manual labor. The government lacks a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address all forms of child labor, including its worst forms. In addition, no government programs exist to aid children engaged in work activities in agriculture.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Azerbaijan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but it was also complicit in the use of forced child labor. The government approved the State Program on developing official statistics, including on child labor, for 2018–2025 and drafted a new National Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in Persons for 2019–2023. However, despite initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because local authorities recruited workers and students to pick cotton at local levels in multiple regions in the country in order to fulfill cotton production quotas. In 2017, the government extended a moratorium on all labor inspections through 2021, which will leave potential violations of child labor laws undetected in workplaces. Children in Azerbaijan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Legal protections only apply to workers with written employment contracts, leaving self-employed children and children working outside of formal employment relationships vulnerable to exploitation. In addition, research found limited evidence of government programs to address child labor in agriculture, the sector in which child labor is most prevalent.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Bangladesh made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a $35 million, 3-year project to eliminate hazardous child labor by identifying and rehabilitating100,000 child laborers. In addition, the Bangladesh Army and Rapid Action Battalion were deployed to assist in the identification and investigation of trafficking cases among Rohingya refugees. The government also adopted a five-year National Plan of Action for the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking. However, children in Bangladesh engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced child labor in the production of dried fish and bricks. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of garments and leather goods. Laws do not cover children working in the informal sector and hazardous work prohibitions are not comprehensive. Moreover, the number of labor inspectors is insufficient for the size of Bangladesh’s workforce, and fines are inadequate to deter child labor law violations.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Belize made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted legislation to create a hazardous work list and light work framework and created a curriculum for labor inspectors to help identify child workers. The Labor Department meanwhile appointed a Senior Labor Officer dedicated specifically to child labor and improving inter agency coordination. In addition, the government expanded its secondary school subsidy program to serve all rural areas in the country. However, children in Belize engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, fishing, and construction. Although Belize made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the country's minimum age for work is 12 and does not meet international standards. In addition, the country lacks prohibitions against the use of children in illicit activities. Also, the government does not appear to have programs that aim to reduce child labor in agriculture, except in the sugar industry.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Benin made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In2018 the government approved a National Action Plan for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, and approved a new Penal Code that enhances protections to victims of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. During the year authorities provided temporary shelter and assistance to 1,214 child victims of trafficking and exploitation. However, children in Benin engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of cotton and crushed granite. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work and street vending. Additionally, the Labor Code's protections, including minimum age for work, do not apply to children working in the informal economy leaving these children at risk to becoming victims of child labor. In addition, limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Bhutan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted standard operating procedures for identifying and referring human trafficking victims. In addition, government personnel received training on human trafficking. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Bhutan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Bhutan’s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards and education is not compulsory. The government has not adopted a national policy to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Bolivia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Following the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal(TCP) decision ruling unconstitutional provisions of the 2014 Child and Adolescent Code which allowed children as young as 10 years old to work, in December 2018President Evo Morales signed complementary legislation that further clarified the minimum age of 14 years by eliminating remaining provisions that permitted children to work at ages 12 and 13. The Labor Inspectorate also increased the number of labor inspectors, mobile inspection units, and the number of inspections conducted throughout the year. In addition, the major sugar-producing Department of Santa Cruz addressed child labor in the sector through several social programs. However, children in Bolivia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although Bolivian law requires that apprentices attend school, it does not set a minimum age for participation in apprenticeships. In addition, Article 1 of Supreme Decree No. 1875 sets the minimum age for compulsory military service at 17 years, which does not comply with international standards.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Bosnia and Herzegovina made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government's Daily Centers identified 130 children as potential victims of human trafficking and referred them to shelters and the number of Regional Monitoring Teams increased from 4 to 17. In addition, the Government of Canton Sarajevo implemented a protocol on cooperation and treatment in cases of unlawful behavior at the detriment of children, which includes protection for child beggars and sexually abused children. However, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The minimum age protections in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and Brčko District do not apply to children who are self-employed or work outside of formal employment relationships. In addition, the Anti-Trafficking Strike Force lacks coordination between prosecutors, police, and other relevant government stakeholders, and border police officers and social workers failed to properly identify unaccompanied migrant and refugee children as potential victims of human trafficking due to lack of proper protocols.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Botswana made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government provided funding for education programs and supported school feeding programs. However, children in Botswana engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor in cattle herding, and forced domestic work. Key gaps remain in the country’s legal framework, including the lack of minimum age for compulsory education and insufficient prohibitions for hazardous work. In addition, social programs do not always reach intended child labor victims, especially those engaged in cattle herding and domestic work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Brazil made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved draft legislation altering the National Education law allowing schools to register children without birth certificates and the police conducted the largest to date operation to combat child pornography, resulting in 89 arrests over 24 states. The number of children rescued from situations of forced child labor also increased by 40 percent, from 1,008 children in 2017 to1,854 in 2018. In addition, the government adopted its third National Plan to Eradicate Child Labor, and its third National Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. However, children in Brazil engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Although Brazil made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government has not established legislation prohibiting child trafficking in compliance with international standards. In addition, there are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce, and local governments lack the capacity to fully implement and monitor the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor, Bolsa Família, and other social protection programs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Burkina Faso made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the course of the reporting period, the government has removed more than 2,000 children from artisanal mining sites and placed them in the care of social services. The government also employed 255 full-time labor inspectors, an increase of more than 50 percent with respect to the previous reporting period, and launched a new National Program of Economic and Social Development (PNDES), which includes child labor elimination and prevention strategies. However, children in Burkina Faso engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in artisanal gold mining and quarrying. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cotton harvesting. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may hinder government efforts to protect children from engaging in the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the Labor Code does not identify the activities in which children may engage in light work.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Burma made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but also was complicit in the use of forced child labor. The government extended the Supplementary Understanding with the International Labor Organization to continue the forced labor complaint mechanism through 2018. The government also committed to the elimination of six grave violations against children, including the recruitment and use of children as soldiers, during the June 2018 Union Peace Conference. Despite these initiatives, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement because its national armed forces forcibly recruited and used children as combatants in armed conflict. The national armed forces also forced children to work as porters, cleaners, and cooks in conflict areas. Children in Burma engage in other worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Government policies also increased children's vulnerability to the worst forms of child labor by denying Rohingya children in Rakhine State access to education due to government restrictions on their movement. In addition, the penalties imposed for recruiting and using children in the military are not appropriate for the seriousness of the crime and the legal framework does not prohibit the recruitment and use of children by non-state armed groups. The government also did not publish information on criminal law enforcement efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict cases involving the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Burundi made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government hired additional labor inspectors, more than doubling the number of those employed to enforce labor laws across the country. However, children in Burundi engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Burundi lacks a compulsory education age that is equal to the minimum age for work. The government’s ability to address the worst forms of child labor was constrained by a lack of necessary resources to conduct labor inspections and criminal investigations, alack of well-trained educators, materials, and infrastructure in the education sector, and insufficient social programs to address child labor in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Cabo Verde made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved and published its first National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons and revised the Education Law to extend free tuition up to the eighth grade. In July, the Observatory for Monitoring and Rapid Identification of Situations of Trafficking in Persons, a major coordinating body created to respond to all human trafficking situations around the archipelago, was also established and convened twice during the year. However, children in Cabo Verde engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Law enforcement officials lack the necessary resources to follow-up on investigations and communication between enforcement agencies is limited. In addition, social programs to assist children involved in agriculture and domestic work are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Cambodia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted amendments to the Labor Law, which ensure application of the minimum age requirement for admission to all types of work outside of an employment relationship, including self-employment. In addition, the Labor Inspectorate revised its factory inspection questionnaire to align with the ILO-Better Factories Cambodia questionnaire, thus eliminating duplicative inspections, and allowing the Labor Inspectorate to become the primary inspection institution. In addition, counter trafficking in persons training curriculum was instituted into the Cambodian National Police academies. However, children in Cambodia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in both forced labor in brick making and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Due to challenges in accessing basic education and the absence of a compulsory education requirement, children are vulnerable to involvement in the worst forms of child labor. Inadequate resources and technical training also hamper the Labor Inspectorate's capacity to enforce child labor laws, especially in rural areas and in high-risk sectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Cameroon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government more than doubled the number of labor inspectors, and removed over 300 children from situations of exploitation and provided them social services. The government also hired more than 3,000 teachers and expanded the scope of a school feeding program which aims to benefit81,500 children in the Adamawa, East, North, and Northwest regions. However, children in Cameroon engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cocoa production. The government has not acceded to the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, nor has it prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, the Central African Republic made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Justice began drafting a law that will reinforce existing laws on the recruitment of children under the age of 18 by armed groups, and criminally prohibit recruitment by non-state groups. In addition, the government participated in the identification, removal, and referral to social services of over 1,800 children associated with armed groups. During the year the government hired additional labor inspectors and provided some inspectors with child labor-specific training. However, children in the Central African Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in diamond mining and armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forced or compulsory recruitment by non-governmental armed groups. An estimated 1.3 million children lacked access to education as a result of ongoing instability, and limited resources hampered the government’s implementation of policies and programs to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Chad made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In March 2018, the Government of Chad ratified an ordinance prohibiting trafficking in persons, sent three labor inspectors to attend a 45-day refresher training at the ILO-accredited African Regional Center for Labor Administration in Cameroon, and launched the Refugees and Host Communities Support Project, which aims to improve access to health and education services for refugees, including children engaged in the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Chad engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in cattle herding and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The country’s legal framework does not contain criminal penalties for the use of children in illicit activities, and austerity measures imposed in 2016 continue to limit government funding for efforts to combat child labor. The government does not systematically collect data on law enforcement efforts and has no active policies for relevant sectors of child labor, such as commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labor in domestic work and herding cattle.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Chile made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a law creating the Office for the Rights of Children, which is charged with disseminating, promoting, and protecting the rights of children and adolescents. The newly established Undersecretary for Childhood, whose designated objectives include ensuring the rights of children and adolescents and coordinating the provision of services, also created a new National Plan of Action for Children and Adolescents. In addition, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights created Chile's first National Human Rights Plan. However, children in Chile engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions related to forced labor do not meet international standards. In addition, there is a lack of publicly available enforcement information, including the number of criminal investigations and prosecutions related to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Colombia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted two new bills, one to strengthen penalties in the Penal Code for crimes of commercial sexual exploitation, and one to establish more comprehensive public policies to protect children against cyber crimes that involve commercial sexual exploitation. The Ministry of Labor also more than doubled its resources dedicated to labor law enforcement and launched the campaign "Working is Not a Child's Task," which aims to prevent and eliminate child labor through awareness raising efforts. In addition, the government adopted the National Policy on Childhood and Adolescence and created the Observatory for the Crime of Trafficking in Persons, whose priorities include analysis of Venezuelan migration and trafficking in persons. However, children in Colombia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, the government does not employ a sufficient number of labor inspectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Comoros made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government carried out labor inspections for the second consecutive year, adding routine and unannounced inspections in 2018. Under the National Policy for the Protection of Children, the government also established two pilot listening sessions for child victims of violence and gathered data from the listening sessions to improve child protection. In addition, the National Commission of Human Rights and Freedoms and the General Delegation organized trainings for police, gendarmerie, and army on children's rights. However, children in Comoros engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. A gap between the minimum age for work and compulsory education age leaves children ages 13 to 15 vulnerable to child labor. In addition, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government convicted two former militia leaders of war crimes, including for the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. The Ministry of Mines also launched a traceability and monitoring system for artisanal mines to detect cases of child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Research indicates that labor inspectors failed to conduct any work site inspections for the third year in a row. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) detained and sometimes committed extra-judicial killing of boys due to their perceived support or affiliation with non-state armed groups. Children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, tin ore (cassiterite), tantalum ore (coltan), and tungsten ore (wolframite), and are used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups. Other gaps remain, including a lack of trained enforcement personnel, limited financial resources, poor coordination of government efforts to combat child labor, and laws mandating free primary education are not enforced.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, the Republic of the Congo made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, enforcement agencies disrupted multiple sex trafficking networks involving children, and in conjunction with a local NGO identified 21 child trafficking victims. The government also initiated the process for implementing a bilateral agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo that would mitigate cross-border movement of unaccompanied children. However, children in the Republic of the Congo engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. The government has yet to accede to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and there is no mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor at the national level, including the worst forms of child labor. For the second year in a row, the government failed to allocate funding to the National Action Plan to Fight Against Trafficking in Persons and did not fund any social services during the reporting period to address trafficking in persons. In addition, information on children's work is extremely limited because there has never been a national child labor survey or similar research conducted in the Republic of the Congo.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Cook Islands, the government made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in 2018. The government ratified ILO Convention C. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period. However, the government did not effectively protect children as the law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Costa Rica made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched new cooperative efforts with non-governmental organizations to develop projects to prevent child labor as part of its Roadmap against Child Labor and the Worst Forms of Child Labor. Costa Rica also amended its Criminal Code to align with international standards on trafficking in persons, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security collaborated with the International Labor Organization to develop a statistical tool that will identify child labor risks. Furthermore, the National Child Welfare Agency issued and trained relevant agencies on a protocol for the care of child victims while the President signed an Executive Order authorizing the countrywide expansion of childcare centers for children of migrant farm workers. However, children in Costa Rica engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children are also engaged in child labor in agriculture. Existing social programs are insufficient to reach all child laborers, and resources for the government’s child labor law enforcement agencies remain inadequate.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Côte d’Ivoire made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed a new 2018-2020 National Action Plan of the Fight Against Trafficking, Exploitation, and Child Labor, as well as a National Labor Inspection Strategy. The First Lady of Côte d’Ivoire signed an MOU for carrying out applied research on child labor in cocoa-growing areas, and opened a child protection center which houses and provides education, medical care, counseling, and vocational training to victims of child labor. The government also took enforcement actions on violations of the worst forms of child labor, including sentencing a child trafficker to three years in prison. However, children in Côte d’Ivoire engage in the worst forms of child labor in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee, sometimes as result of human trafficking. Gaps remain in resources, personnel, and training for law enforcement, which resulted in victims being arrested for crimes they were forced to commit. Furthermore, the Labor Inspectorate is not authorized to assess penalties.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Djibouti made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the Djibouti National Police created a sub-unit to investigate child begging and forced child begging. In addition, the Anti-Trafficking Working Group improved coordination, which resulted in more holistic protective services and investigations of potential trafficking cases, including of children. However, children in Djibouti engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Law enforcement efforts are inadequate as the number of labor inspectors is insufficient for the size of the labor force and they lack the authority to assess penalties. Additionally, overall coordination is lacking in efforts to address all forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Dominica made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government made public its number of labor inspectors, demonstrating that it meets the International Labor Organization's benchmark given the size of its workforce. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Dominica engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Dominica's legal framework does not protect children from exploitative work outside of the school year and the government has not determined the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. The country also lacks prohibitions against the use of children in prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances, and the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, the Dominican Republic made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the Labor Inspectorate's budget from $3.3 million in 2017 to $4.8 million in 2018.The government also approved the National Action Plan against Human Trafficking and continued to fund and participate in multiple programs that include the goal of eliminating or preventing child labor, including expanding the Extended School Day program to cover 1.3 million students. However, children in the Dominican Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain, including limited human and financial resources for the enforcement of child labor laws and inadequate assistance for children engaged in harmful agricultural work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Ecuador made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Assembly's Workers' Rights Committee presented legislation to reform Ecuador's Labor Code to strengthen provisions related to the eradication of child labor. The National Assembly also passed the Law to Prevent and Eradicate Violence against Women, which includes protections for girls and women who become victims of sexual exploitation. In addition, the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion signed agreements to strengthen child labor prevention efforts with local governments. The Ministry of the Interior also began drafting a new National Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, as well as a2018-2021 update to the current National Plan to Eradicate Child Labor. However, children in Ecuador engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The labor inspectorate continues to lack sufficient resources.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Egypt made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Social Solidarity provided supplemental financial support to over 1.6 million individuals to support children's school attendance. The government also supported the enrollment of 44,000 refugee children in schools and formally adopted the National Plan of Action Against the Worst Forms of Child Labor and Supporting Family, as well as the National Strategy on Childhood and Motherhood, which also has a section on child labor. However, children in Egypt engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in quarrying limestone. The government did not publish data on the enforcement of child labor laws. In addition, programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, El Salvador made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government extended its National Action Plan for the Protection of Children and Adolescents into 2019 and modified its process for granting adolescents work permits, both with the goal of aligning laws and policies with international standards and national legislation. El Salvador also published its Annual Household Survey with data on child labor, as well as a guide highlighting efforts to combat child labor in the sugarcane industry. In addition, the government launched the local government component of its Sustainable Families Strategy in 16 municipalities and implemented an inter-agency protocol to improve coordination of services for human trafficking victims. However, children in El Salvador engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in illicit activities, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of coffee. Law enforcement agencies continue to lack sufficient resources to fully enforce child labor laws.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>  In 2018, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Although Eritrea made some efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, government officials were complicit but was also complicit in the use of forced child labor in agriculture and military training. The government conducted 985 labor inspections during the year and provided education services to 8,575 out-of-school children in rural and remote areas.  However, Eritrea is receiving this assessment because it continued to force students in grade 12, some of whom are under the age of 18, to participate in military training elements of the government’s compulsory national service program, as well as forced agricultural labor. Evidence collected suggests that the national program called Maetot, in which children engage in compulsory labor in agricultural, environmental, and hygiene-related public works projects did not take place during the reporting period due to financial constraints preventing implementation. However, Maetot remains an integral component of the government's national service framework. The government does not make law enforcement data publicly available and national laws and regulations do not identify hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children. In addition, the government does not have a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address the worst forms of child labor.  </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Eswatini made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The King signed the Sexual Offenses and Domestic Violence Act, which provides new legal protections for child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Additionally, the government drafted a revised Employment Act that will expand the authority of labor inspectors and criminalize the non-state recruitment of children. However, children in Eswatini engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and herding livestock. Significant gaps in the legal framework remain, including a lack of legislation regulating the labor conditions under Kuhlehla and other customary practices and a defacto compulsory education age that does not meet international standards. In addition, social programs do not adequately address child labor in the agriculture sector. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Ethiopia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Anti-Human Trafficking and Smuggling of Migrants Task Force worked with the ILO to map service providers working on migration issues in order to improve coordination and collaboration. The government also nearly quadrupled the Labor Inspectorate's budget from its 2017 allocation, and in collaboration with the World Bank and UNICEF, it distributed 117 million textbooks and constructed 260 primary school classrooms. However, children in Ethiopia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The law in Ethiopia does not include free basic education or a compulsory age for education, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor have also not sufficiently targeted sectors with high incidences of child labor.</Description>

In addition, the minimum age for work and hazardous work do not meet international standards and the law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Fiji made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government is extending its Free Education Grant to 52 additional schools over the next two years. The government also made addressing child labor a strategic priority of its labor inspectorate and allocated additional resources and conducted additional inspections as part of the effort. However, children in Fiji engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government has not approved the draft National Action Plan for Child Labor, the 5-year Strategic Plan for Combating Child Labor, the National Plan of Action to Eradicate Trafficking in Persons and Child Trafficking, the National Action Plan on the Eradication of Child Labor, and the Inter-Agency Trafficking Task Force has not been active since 2012. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Gabon made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government investigated 16 individuals for forced child labor and signed bilateral agreements with Benin and Togo to combat child trafficking. The Senate also approved amendments to the Penal Code that increased penalties for human trafficking. Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Gabon is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it failed to conduct worksite inspections during the reporting period. Children in Gabon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. The government also lacks prohibitions against the use of children in illicit activities and the minimum age for work provisions only apply to children in formal employment relationships,  excluding children who work in the informal sector. In addition, labor inspectors do not have the authority to assess penalties, and they lack the basic resources, such as transportation, fuel, and office supplies, necessary to conduct investigations.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, The Gambia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government published detailed information related to the criminal enforcement of child labor and provided $50,000 of funding to the National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons. It also provided trainings to hotel staff in support of the Code of Conduct of The Gambia Tourism Authority for the Protection of Children. However, children in The Gambia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking and forced begging. Gaps in the law remain, including that children may commence an apprenticeship in the informal sector at the age of 12, an age below the compulsory education age of 16. Although the government has adopted various policies addressing human trafficking, research also found no evidence of a policy on other worst forms of child labor. In addition, the scope of social programs is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem, as programs do not reach all children working in agriculture and domestic work, or those vulnerable to human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging, and street work.        </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Georgia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Georgia passed the Law on Occupational Safety to allow unannounced inspections in harmful, hazardous, and heavy industries, and carried out 90 unannounced inspections in these industries. The government also approved a National Action Plan on Human Trafficking for 2019–2020 to protect and integrate street children through issuing identity documents and inclusive education. However, children in Georgia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including inforced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Labor Inspectorate is allowed to only conduct unannounced inspections in harmful, hazardous, and heavy industries and requires a court order to inspect all other businesses in the country. In addition, the compulsory education age leaves 15-year-old children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor, as they are not required to be in school, but are not legally permitted to work full-time. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Ghana made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government secured at least14 convictions for offenses related to the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the National Plan of Action Phase II on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor and launched a strategy to combat child labor in the fishing sector. The Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection-run "Get off the Street" program rescued 78 children in Accra and referred them to appropriate social support services. However, children in Ghana continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in fishing and cocoa harvesting as a result of human trafficking. Prohibitions related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. The government also has not acceded to the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and resource constraints severely limited government social protection agencies’ abilities to fully implement social programs during the reporting period.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Grenada made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although research found no evidence that child labor, including its worst forms, exists in Grenada, no study of child labor has been done to confirm this. The government's ability to prevent children from becoming engaged in the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition, there are insufficient prohibitions against children’s involvement in hazardous work and illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Guatemala made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. A Ministerial Accord enabling the Ministry of Labor and Social Securtiy's Labor Inspectorate to collect fines for labor violations entered into force and the Public Ministry created a new regional Anti-Trafficking Unit in Quetzaltenango to improve and expedite the prosecution of trafficking cases. The government also published the functioning guide for the Departmental Committees for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor and launched 21 committees. In addition, the government reactivated its National Working Group for the Prevention and Protection of Children and Adolescents against Sexual Exploitation in Activities Related to Travel and Tourism and conducted a population and housing survey with updated data on child labor that will be published in 2019.However, children in Guatemala are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The lack of a sufficient number of labor inspectors and resources limited the Ministry of Labor's ability to combat the worst forms of child labor, particularly in rural areas outside the capital. In addition, existing social programs are insufficient to reach all children engaged in exploitative labor and, in particular, do not target children working in domestic service or agriculture.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Guinea made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government organized a training on forced labor and trafficking in conjunction with the ILO for members of the police and gendarmerie and published statistics related to the criminal enforcement of child labor laws. However, children in Guinea engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor and corruption in law enforcement agencies and the judiciary impede enforcement efforts. In addition, the government does not implement sufficient social programs to address the extent of the child labor problem.        </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Guinea-Bissau made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented the Code of Conduct Against Sexual Exploitation in Tourism by conducting various awareness raising campaigns on the commercial sexual exploitation of children for hotel and night club owners, and throughout Bissau and the Bijagós archipelago. The government also hired 13 additional labor inspectors and provided over 150 child victims of human trafficking for forced begging with reintegration, medical assistance, and shelter. However, children in Guinea-Bissau engage in the worst forms of child labor in forced begging. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. In addition, the government has not determined the types of hazardous work prohibited for children and law enforcement officials do not receive the appropriate training and resources to adequately conduct inspections and prosecute cases of child labor. Further, social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Guyana made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In August 2018, the government established a trafficking in persons unit within the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission responsible for registering and categorizing local and foreign workers in the hinterland, including children. The government also approved the National Policy on Child Labor which aims to eradicate child labor by 2025, and contributed $300,000 to NGO run shelters for human trafficking victims. However, children in Guyana continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Law enforcement agencies have insufficient financial and human resources to enforce laws related to child labor, including its worst forms, and existing laws do not fully prohibit using children in certain forms of child labor. Moreover, the government does not have targeted social programs to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Haiti made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government established, trained, and deployed a specialized unit of border police known as the POLIFRONT to combat transnational crime, including human trafficking. It also secured 17 convictions for crimes related to the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Haiti perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and domestic work. Children are also placed in orphanages where some are subsequently used for domestic work. Haiti lacks a clear, easily applicable minimum age for domestic work and a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. In addition, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>Honduras made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Congress approved a new Penal Code that updates penalties for human trafficking. The Ministry of Labor also released a new national strategy for its labor inspectorate and the Inter-agency Commission against Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons obtained administrative and budget autonomy. As part of implementing its Roadmap to Eliminate Child Labor, Honduras installed a National Council for Youth and Adolescents. In addition, the government enacted a new Penal Code in January 2018 which provides extraterritorial jurisdiction in the prosecution of human trafficking crimes. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it did not provide information about criminal law enforcement efforts related to the worst forms of child labor, limiting the ability to assess the effectiveness of its criminal enforcement. Children in Honduras engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking and in agriculture. Labor and criminal law enforcement agencies experience financial and human resource challenges that may hinder effective law enforcement. In addition, the government’s social programs that address child labor in agriculture do not appear sufficient to address the scope of the problem nationwide and the government lacks social programs to eliminate child labor in other dangerous activities, such as fishing, mining, and domestic work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, India made a significant advancement in  efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted the Trafficking of Persons (Prevent, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, which criminalizes and enhances penalties for aggravated forms of trafficking, including trafficking for the purposes of forced labor, bonded labor, and begging. It also established a new task force to ensure the implementation of the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act. Police and child protection officers in several states conducted raids to rescue children from hazardous child labor and commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi issued standard operating procedures for the immediate release of financial assistance to adults and children rescued from bonded labor. However, children in India engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor producing garments and quarrying stones. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of thread and yarn. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work in unsafe and unhealthy environments for long periods of time, and penalties for employing children are insufficient to deter violations. In addition, the central government did not collect and publish data on state government efforts to enforce child labor laws and criminal law prohibiting the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Indonesia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government substantially increased its Labor Inspectorate funding from $2.1 million in 2017 to $10.2 million with specific funds allocated to enforcing child labor regulations. It also conducted 19,792 labor inspections and continued working with the International Organization for Migration to establish a comprehensive integrated Trafficking in Persons database. However, children in Indonesia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as the result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in palm oil and tobacco production. The Ministry of Manpower continued to lack the financial resources and personnel necessary to adequately enforce child labor laws throughout the country. In addition, the Domestic Workers Protection Bill, which has been under consideration since 2010, continued to languish in parliament.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>  In 2018,Iraq made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament endorsed the Iraqi Law to Combat Human Trafficking. The Iraqi Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs increased the number of inspections, shut down several brick factories for violations of child labor laws, and continued its cash transfer program for at-risk children and families. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Iraq is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The security forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government arrested, detained, and tortured children who were suspected of having ties with ISIS in order to coerce confessions. The confessions were then used as evidence to convict and sentence children, including those who had been forcibly recruited and used by ISIS in armed conflict, to imprisonment on terrorism charges. In addition, militia groups loosely associated with the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)recruited children during the reporting period. Despite the formal incorporation of the PMF into the security services, the Government of Iraq struggled to assert command and control over all PMF units. Children in Iraq engage in other worst forms of child labor, including forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Labor law enforcement suffers from an insufficient number of labor inspectors and a lack of funding for inspections, authority to assess penalties, and labor inspector training. There is no child labor policy in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and research could not find information on the implementation of the existing policy in Iraq. The government also continues to lack programs that focus on assisting children involved in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Jamaica made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published the results of its Jamaica National Youth Activity Survey and increased its number of labor inspectors to meet recommended international enforcement standards. Jamaica also amended two pieces of legislation related to human trafficking and established the U.S.-Jamaica Child Protection Compact (CPC) Partnership to combat child trafficking. However, children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and illicit activities. Jamaica's Labor Inspectorate lacks the authority to assess penalties for labor law violations and although the government has laws prohibiting the use of children in some illicit activities, it does not provide higher penalties for using, procuring, or offering children for the production and distribution of drugs compared to those for using adults.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Jordan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased the number of labor inspections for the second consecutive year and enrolled over130,000 Syrian refugee children in schools. In addition, the government continued to provide shelter, educational, and financial services to children engaged in child labor, including in the city of Irbid and in the Palestinian refugee camp in Marka. However, children in Jordan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in street work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Insufficient resources hampered the Ministry of Labor’s capacity to ensure compliance with child labor laws in the agricultural sector. Despite government efforts, Syrian children still face barriers to accessing education due to costs associated with transportation, school fees, and supplies, among other issues. In addition, the government did not implement sufficient social programs to fully address child labor, particularly in agriculture, construction, and street vending.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Kazakhstan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Education and Science, in cooperation with other government agencies, carried out targeted joint inspection operations in areas where child labor may occur and the government adopted a new national action plan to counter trafficking in persons. However, children in Kazakhstan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in cotton harvesting and commercial sexual exploitation. The government lacks programs to address child labor in cotton harvesting, as well as current, comprehensive, and detailed research on child labor. The government also does not have a policy that addresses all relevant forms of child labor in the country. In addition, the complaint mechanism did not allow for anonymous individuals to report violations of labor laws and not a single case of child labor was reported to government hotlines on children's issues.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Kenya made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government greatly increased the number of labor inspectors, inspections conducted, and child labor violations identified. However, children in Kenya engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Kenya has yet to ratify the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. In addition, the minimum age for work law does not protect children working outside the scope of a formal employment contract or in circumstances in which children derive no benefit from their labor. The government has also not committed sufficient resources to child labor enforcement. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Kiribati made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented the United Nations Pacific Strategy, which applies a strategic framework to develop and employ economic development strategies, including eliminating the worst forms of child labor. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Kiribati perform dangerous tasks in construction and street vending. Existing laws also do not identify hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children, and the government has not adopted a national policy to combat the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Kosovo made a moderate advancement to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a new Criminal Code that prohibited the recruitment of children into non-state armed groups and increased penalties for producing, using, or involving children in the production, possession, or procurement of child pornography. Teachers in Prizren Municipality were also trained on identifying children at risk of being trafficked and the Kosovo Police received child trafficking training, including on the use of children in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities. In addition, the government passed a Children's Rights Action Plan for 2019 to 2021that aims to improve the social, economic, and legislative rights of children. However, children in Kosovo engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The Labor Inspectorate and Centers for Social Welfare continue to face financial and human resource constraints which impede their ability to address child labor. In addition, human trafficking shelters lack sufficient funding to properly accommodate and treat child trafficking victims.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, the Kyrgyz Republic made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government continued evening classes for secondary school students in districts with high numbers of child laborers and a cash transfer program for families living in difficult situations. However, children in the Kyrgyz Republic engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. The government’s child trafficking laws are not in line with international standards, and research indicates that the State Inspectorate on Ecological and Technical Safety employed an insufficient number of labor inspectors. In addition, the compulsory education age remained lower than the minimum age for work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Lebanon made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education adopted the Policy for the Protection of Students in the School Environment to protect children's right to education. The government also issued a new regulation for Syrian refugee children ages 15-17 that eases their access to education. In addition, the President launched a choir to raise awareness on child labor and empower former child laborers. However, children in Lebanon engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in construction and in forced labor in agriculture. Children also engage in child labor in the production of potatoes and tobacco. The Ministry of Labor’s budget was unable to cover equipment, personnel, and transport costs to conduct inspections and labor inspectors do not have the authority to assess penalties. In addition, programs targeting child labor remained insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Lesotho made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Employment updated the labor code, assigned labor inspectors to operate a Child Labor Desk within Ministry, and provided recommendations that supported the expansion of inspections into the informal sector. However, children in Lesotho continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in animal herding, domestic work, and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Lesotho’s compulsory education age is below the minimum age for work, leaving children in between these ages vulnerable to child labor. The government also still lacks sufficient mechanisms to combat child labor, and current enforcement efforts are undermined by barriers to youth education and questions surrounding enforcement within courts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Liberia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government increased the number of labor inspectors and implemented the National Child Welfare and Protection Policy, which is a coordinating mechanism that focuses on the implementation and enforcement of child labor laws. However, children in Liberia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of rubber, and mining gold and diamonds. The government has not yet endorsed the National Action Plan on Child Labor. The Liberia National Police’s Women and Children Protection Section and the National Commission on Child Labor continue to lack sufficient resources to conduct investigations and enforce child labor laws. In addition, the compulsory education age is lower than the minimum age for work, making 15-year-old children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor because they are not required to attend school, but are not legally permitted to work until age 16.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Madagascar made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new decree to make child labor legislation more comprehensive and approved the ratification of ILO Convention 189 on Domestic Workers and Protocol 29 of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention. The government also partnered with outside organizations to increase awareness of child labor and strengthen child labor law enforcement in isolated regions. In addition, the government continued to participate in a number of programs targeting the worst forms of child labor, including expanding a cash transfer program to benefit 65,000 households in seven regions of Madagascar. However, children in Madagascar engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of vanilla. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government failed to impose penalties for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Malawi made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government debated an amendment to the Employment Act that would prohibit tenancy farming, and passed the Tobacco Industry Bill of 2018 which requires tobacco growers to report on efforts to eliminate child labor in tobacco farming. The government also finalized the National Children's Policy which will begin implementation in 2019.In addition, government inspectors also facilitated the removal of more than1,000 victims of child labor and referred them to social services provided by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Welfare However, children in Malawi continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the harvesting of tobacco and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as the result of human trafficking. The government has not finalized or fully implemented key legislation or policies to protect children from child labor, including the Child Labor Policy and the Child Protection Policy. In addition, gaps continue to exist in labor law enforcement related to child labor, including financial resource allocation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Maldives made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Maldives Police Service conducted awareness raising programs for 36 guesthouse operators and resort managers on protecting children from commercial sexual exploitation within the tourism industry. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Maldives engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government has not determined specific hazardous occupations or activities that are prohibited for children, and the law does not sufficiently prohibit commercial sexual exploitation of children. Moreover, the government does not have a coordinating mechanism, policy, or program that address all relevant worst forms of child labor in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Mali made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government finalized the National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking of Persons and allocated a budget of $10 million over 5 years for implementation. The government also convicted one perpetrator for attempting to traffic three children to Cote d'Ivoire and provided services to 53 victims of child soldiering, of which 21 were reunited with their families. Finally, under the National Policy for Promotion and Protection of Children, the government conducted activities to increase birth registration. However, children in Mali engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in the production of cotton and rice. Mali's law does not comprehensively prohibit hereditary slavery in cases where recruitment, transport, transfer, harboring or receipt of a person is not involved nor does the law explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities. In addition, resource constraints severely limited the government’s ability to fully implement the National Plan to Combat Child Labor and existing social programs are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem, particularly in artisanal gold mining, hereditary slavery, and debt bondage.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Mauritania made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government approved a new General Child Protection Code that expanded the number of hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children, increased penalties to deter violations, and established birth registration as a right and duty. The government also established a National Council for Child Protection and allocated a budget of $100,000 to manage social centers for vulnerable children, including talibés. Despite these new initiatives to address child labor, Mauritania is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implemented a practice and policy that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, criminal law enforcement authorities did not make adequate efforts to combat slavery and its vestiges. Specifically, the government did not adequately prosecute or secure convictions in slavery cases, and reports continue to indicate that some government actors, including police and judicial authorities, are unwilling to pursue such cases. In addition, since 2011, the government has required proof of marriage and biological parents’ citizenship for children to obtain a birth certificate. As a result, children born out of wedlock and many Haratine and sub-Saharan ethnic minority children, including those of slave descent, have been prevented from being registered at birth. Because birth certificates are required for enrollment in secondary school in Mauritania, children as young as age 12 cannot access education, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mauritania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary slavery. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in herding cattle and goats. The government did not make sufficient efforts to raise awareness of laws that prohibit slavery and enforce some laws related to the worst forms of child labor, including on hereditary slavery and forced begging. In addition, lack of financial resources severely limited the relevant government agencies’ ability to fully implement policies, and social programs to combat the worst forms of child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Mauritius made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government implemented a National Sports Policy that created a structured after school program for children. It also increased its labor inspections by 55 percent and approved a Special Education Needs Bill, which will reduce barriers to children with special needs accessing education. However, children in Mauritius engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. The government lacks a national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. The Coordinating Committee on Child Labor, established in 2017, also is no longer active and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to address the extent of the problem. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Moldova made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed Government Decree No. 378 to grant allowances to children left without parental care until the age of 18. Labor inspectors also attended regional workshops to combat human trafficking, including a policy planning workshop organized by the Permanent Secretariat for the National Committee for Combating Trafficking in Person and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Moldova is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because of a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Amendments to Law No. 131 and 179 allow the State Labor Inspectorate to conduct announced and unannounced on-site inspections only if insufficient documentation is provided by the individual being inspected, if a written complaint is received, and if a risk assessment contains reasonable indicators of a possible violation. In addition, the State Labor Inspectorate can only focus on the alleged violation outlined in the complaint, even if other violations, such as child labor, are uncovered. Due to government restructuring, no occupational health and safety inspections were conducted during the reporting period. Children in Moldova engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. There are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce and training is needed for new investigators. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Mongolia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government conducted two major surveys on child labor and protection issues. In addition, the Family, Child, and Youth Development Agency, the General Agency for Specialized Investigation, and the ILO conducted a joint training on preventing child and forced labor for 64 child rights officers and labor inspectors. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mongolia is receiving this assessment because the government did not permit the Labor Inspectorate to conduct unannounced inspections, which impeded the enforcement of child labor laws. Children in Mongolia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining and horse jockeying. Mongolia continues to have a number of legal statutes that do not meet international standards for the protection of children.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Montenegro made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Interior's Beggar Task Force investigated 246 people, out of which 33 were juveniles and 22 children were sent to Social Welfare Centers. Labor inspectors also received trainings on forced child labor and informal work from the Ministry of Interior’s Office for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons and the ILO. In addition, the Supreme State Prosecutor and Police Director adopted a decision to establish a Counter Human Trafficking Task Force and the government passed the Strategy for Inclusive Education, which aims to provide education to all children in the country, including children with disabilities. Moreover, the Shelter for Victims of Human Trafficking, Forced Begging, and Forced Marriages helped four minors in 2018. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government did not secure convictions related to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Montenegro engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, research found no evidence of programs to systematically address child labor in street work or forced begging.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Montserrat, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018.During the reporting period, the Labor Office used media programming to inform children and adults of the legal age to work in the country. However, the government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Morocco made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published information on criminal and labor law enforcement efforts, in addition to investigating and prosecuting criminal cases involving child labor violations. Moreover, it operated child protection centers and continued to fund the Tayssir Conditional Cash Transfer Program, providing direct cash transfers to qualifying families whose children meet school attendance criteria, reaching more than 2 million students in 2018. The government also launched social programs focused on providing vocational training to at-risk youth, and assistance to street children at risk of child labor. In addition, it drafted legislation to enhance enforcement abilities in the artisanal sector, specifically allowing labor inspectors to enter into private workshops employing any number of employees. However, children in Morocco engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. The scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Mozambique made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Law on the National System of Education, raising the compulsory education age to 15. The government also drafted a revision to the Labor Law establishing 15 as the minimum age for work and eliminating the exception that allows children as young as 12 to work. Furthermore, the Attorney General's office significantly increased its training capacity and expanded training for law enforcement officers, including a series of workshops for journalists focusing on victim identification and reporting methods that ensure victim safety and preserve the government's ability to prosecute human trafficking cases. However, children in Mozambique engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of tobacco. Labor inspectors do not receive sufficient training and resources to enforce child labor laws and a coordination mechanism solely addressing child labor is lacking. In addition, existing programs are insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>  In 2018, Namibia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed the Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act and approved the National Referral Mechanism that directs first-line response teams on how to detect and provide services to victims of trafficking. In addition, it also provided substantive training for law enforcement pertaining to child protection, including child labor. However, children in Namibia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in domestic work and street work. Hazardous work prohibitions for children in the services sector are not comprehensive. In addition, social programs do not address child labor in agriculture.   </Description>

    <Description>  In 2018, Nepal made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Nepal Labor Force Survey, which will be able to provide valuable information on child labor, including the number of children engaged in hazardous work. It also drafted revisions to the Child Labor Act of 2002, with the aim of raising the minimum age to 18 for entry into hazardous work and ensuring that the list of hazardous work for children is comprehensive. In addition, the government created a new National Child Labor Committee to coordinate efforts to address child labor and passed the new National Master Action Plan (NMP-II) to End Child Labor, which prioritizes ending the worst forms of child labor by 2022, and all forms of child labor by 2025. Moreover, the government launched a Decent Work Country Program and the Social Security Fund Program to support workers and their families and combat child labor. However, children in Nepal engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of bricks. The Department of Labor’s budget, the number of labor inspectors, and available resources and training are all insufficient for enforcing labor laws, including those related to child labor. Furthermore, children age 17 are excluded from the protections of the country’s hazardous work list, leaving them vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Nicaragua made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government released its National Action Plan against Human Trafficking and provided trainings to government officials on identifying and caring for victims of human trafficking. However, children in Nicaragua engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. National policies to eliminate child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented, and the government lacks a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor. In addition, the government does not dedicate sufficient resources to child labor law enforcement and does not publish complete criminal law enforcement data on child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Niger made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Supreme Court set a legal precedent banning the practice of wahaya, a form of slavery in Niger in which men buy girls born into slavery, typically between ages 9 and 11, as “fifth wives. "The government also adopted a law to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, including children, to prevent their exploitation in the worst forms of child labor. Over 300 judges, magistrates, and law enforcement officials received training on investigating and prosecuting trafficking in persons cases, and government officials participated in a regional workshop to reinforce counter-trafficking coordination among member countries of the Economic Community of West Africa. In addition, the government continued to educate religious leaders on how to combat the worst forms of child labor and implemented several other programs to address the worst forms of child labor, including a program that aims to combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling. However, children in Niger engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, existing child labor laws and regulations do not apply to children in unpaid or non-contractual work. Gaps in labor law enforcement, such as funding to conduct labor inspections have also left children unprotected from the worst forms of child labor. In addition, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Nigeria made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted the Edo State Trafficking in Persons Prohibition Law and created the Edo State Taskforce for implementation. Nigeria's National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons received $715,100 for victim care in 2018, a three-fold increase over its 2017 allocation, and government officials appropriated $3.8 million to provide training and education materials to discourage youth from becoming victims of human trafficking. Criminal investigators also conducted 314 investigations into the worst forms of child labor, resulting in 5 convictions.  Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, Nigeria's security forces continued to detain children for prolonged periods of time due to their alleged association with Boko Haram, including girls who were used as concubines. Children engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in quarrying granite and gravel, commercial sexual exploitation, and armed conflict. Other gaps remain, including inconsistencies regarding child labor in the legal framework, and the minimum age for work is below international standards. Furthermore, there are not enough labor inspectors to provide sufficient coverage of the workforce and social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Niue, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in 2018.The government implemented the United Nations Pacific Strategy, which includes economic development strategies, including eliminating child labor and the worst forms of child labor. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Niue has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>  In 2018, North Macedonia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Law on Labor Relations to prohibit children under the age of 15or who have not completed compulsory education from working, except under limited circumstances. Funding was also sufficient for both labor and criminal law enforcement to combat child labor and the National Coordination Body for Protection of Children from Abuse and Neglect was reconstituted. However, children in North Macedonia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. The law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships. In addition, labor inspectors are disproportionately distributed across the country, causing some businesses to be inspected more than others. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Oman made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Sultan of Oman promulgated a new Penal Code that enhanced penalties related to commercial sexual exploitation of children. The National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking signed an agreement with the Oman Lawyers Association to allow attorneys to represent victims of human trafficking on a pro bono basis. The Committee also launched and began implementing a new National Action Plan for Combating Human Trafficking and conducted awareness raising activities. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Oman engage in child labor, including in fishing and selling items in kiosks. Labor inspectors lacked the authority to assess penalties for labor violations, and the government lacks a reciprocal referral mechanism between the Labor Inspectorate and social services.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Pakistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. All four provincial governments started conducting child labor surveys, which will constitute the first nationwide child labor survey since 1995. The federal government also passed the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act and convicted its first child pornography case. In addition, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh provinces each adopted new policies that will address child labor. However, children in Pakistan engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and in bonded labor in brick kilns. Although the federal and provincial governments made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the federal government and Balochistan Province have not established a minimum age for work or hazardous work in compliance with international standards. In addition, provincial governments do not have the resources necessary to effectively enforce laws prohibiting child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Panama made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted modifications to its hazardous work regulations, significantly increased its number of labor inspectors, and established a Regional Headquarters in Cocle to target child labor in areas outside the capital city. It also launched a national initiative to prevent violence against children, which includes the goal of eliminating child labor and conducted a new study on child work, child labor, and the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Panama engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, Panamanian law allows minors under age 16 to engage in hazardous work within training establishments. Moreover, the Labor Inspectorate lacks the authority to collect fines for labor violation, limiting its capacity to enforce laws on the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Papua New Guinea made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Department of Community Development, Youth, and Religion distributed the first Child Care Center licenses. However, children in Papua New Guinea engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Laws do not specifically define the hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children. Papua New Guinea also does not have laws that prohibit using, procuring, or offering a child for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Insufficient resources hamper the Labor Inspectorate’s capacity to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Paraguay made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Recently elected President Abdo Benitez and the Paraguayan Congress upgraded the Secretariat of Adolescents and Children to a full ministry-level body, which allows greater access to high-level political decisions and its own budget. The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security also opened a new regional office in Filadelfia (Chaco region) and the Ministry of Women's Affairs conducted training for 1,500 individuals in at-risk communities and high-risk industries on human trafficking and avoiding victimization. In addition, the National Commission to Prevent and Eradicate the Exploitation of Children updated its action plan for the 2018 - 2020 period and the government updated the National Strategy for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor and Protection of Working Adolescents for the 2018 - 2023 period. However, children in Paraguay are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in cattle raising and domestic servitude, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Limited funding for law enforcement agencies and social programs hampered the government’s ability to fully address the worst forms of child labor, particularly in rural areas.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Peru made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Labor Inspection Superintendency (SUNAFIL) opened two new inspection offices and added approximately $14 million to its 2018 budget. Congress also passed legislation to strengthen the labor inspectorate system by temporarily transferring competencies, functions and staff from the Regional Governments to SUNAFIL. In addition, the government renewed the National Pan to Combat Forced Labor and the National Policy Against Trafficking in Persons. However, children in Peru engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Peruvian law allows children ages 12 to 14 to do light work without specifying the activities in which children may work. In addition, labor law enforcement agencies in Peru lack sufficient inspectors and training to adequately combat child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, the Philippines made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government commenced a nationwide profiling of child laborers and issued Administrative Order No. 142-18, Guidelines on the Profiling of Child Laborers and Provision of Service to Remove Them from Child Labor, to harmonize the process of removing children from child labor and referring them to appropriate services. It permanently closed down a motel that was found to engage children in prostitution and obscene shows, and approved the Guidelines on the Management of Compensation for Victim-Survivors of Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children. However, children in the Philippines engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict, and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and gold mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the government did not adequately protect children engaged in drug trafficking from inappropriate incarceration, penalties, or physical harm. In addition, the enforcement of child labor laws remains challenging, especially due to the limited number of inspectors, lack of resources for inspections, and inspectors’ inability to assess penalties. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Rwanda made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted several new laws to strengthen protections for children, including a revised Labor Law, regulations on combatting human trafficking, a law imposing heightened penalties for the use of children in armed conflict or illicit activities, and the Law on Child Protection that supplements the existing 2012 law. The government also established the Rwanda Investigation Bureau, which conducts investigations into criminal matters, including child labor, and actively partnered with USAID and IOM to conduct a research study on human trafficking trends in Rwanda as part of the Trafficking in Persons Action Plan. In addition, the government obtained one conviction in a child trafficking case and launched a 5-year advocacy campaign against child labor. However, children in Rwanda engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The number of labor inspectors does not meet the ILO's technical advice to effectively enforce child labor laws. In addition, resource constraints limited some government efforts to combat child labor and social programs did not address all relevant sectors where child labor was present.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha (formerly Saint Helena), the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018. The government passed a bill to restrict child labor and improved services for vulnerable children. However, the government has yet to define by law or regulation the types of work prohibited to children, other than work on vessels engaged in maritime navigation. Gaps also remain in legislation related to forced child labor and the trafficking of children for labor exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Saint Lucia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Computer Misuse Act to criminalize the possession of child pornography. It also established a new agency to oversee adoption, child care, and protection of children and published the National Child Protection Action Plan Report. A rapid assessment conducted by the ILO in 2016 revealed limited evidence that children in Saint Lucia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and the sale and transportation of drugs. Saint Lucia's law does not fully protect children from hazardous work and illicit activities. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government increased the budget for the Labor Inspectorate and the number of labor inspectors. The Government also trained criminal law enforcement personnel. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Limited research also suggests children perform dangerous tasks in begging. Gaps remain in the legal framework, as the minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards, and there is no law to prohibit the use of children in the production of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Samoa made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government  issued a public notice clarifying the list of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the government established the Government Grant to Mission and Public Schools—a grant that provides financial assistance to low income students—as a continuation of the current School Fee Grant Scheme. However, children in Samoa engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street vending. Research found no evidence of laws that ban using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. The government also lacks a mechanism to coordinate interagency efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Senegal made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The second phase of Retrait de la Rue began- a program to remove children engaged in forced begging in the Dakar area. A revision of the 2005 anti-trafficking in persons law was also introduced with an aim to widen the law's use by prosecutors since it has been seldom applied in the past. Furthermore, the government published additional information related to labor law enforcement. However, children in Senegal engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Criminal and labor law enforcement agencies lack adequate resources to carry out their work, and redundancy among coordinating bodies to combat child labor hinders collaboration. Furthermore, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children do not include domestic work and street work, areas where there is evidence of child involvement.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Serbia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted the Law on the Rights of the Child and Protection of Child Rights and launched a RoadMap for Eliminating Abuse of Child Labor in Serbia. The Council for Children's Rights drafted a Strategy for Protection of Children from Violence and the Ministry of Interior developed Standard Operating Procedures for Human Trafficking Victims Protections. In addition, the government provided cash transfers to 380,000 vulnerable families with children and government applied penalties in 25 criminal cases related to child labor. However, children in Serbia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Serbia's laws do not treat child beggars as victims and Serbia's social welfare centers are overburdened, which limits efforts to combat  child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Sierra Leone made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government donated three months of President Bio's salary to eliminate school fees for more than two million students in primary and secondary education. Despite this initiative to address child labor, Sierra Leone is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement a policy that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The government continued to prohibit girls who were pregnant from attending regular public schools or taking secondary and postsecondary school entrance exams during the reporting period, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Sierra Leone engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in diamond mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Sierra Leone’s laws do not adequately protect children from involvement in hazardous work, and the country has not implemented its national action plan on child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, the Solomon Islands made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Anti-Human Trafficking Advisory Committee became an authorized organization to lobby and influence the government on trafficking-related issues, including child trafficking. However, children in the Solomon Islands engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The minimum age for employment does not meet international standards, and the government has not comprehensively identified the hazardous occupations prohibited for children. In addition, education is not compulsory, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor exploitation.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Somalia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the government drafted a National Employment Policy and an updated Labor Code. Additionally, government forces rescued 32 children who had been kidnapped by al-Shabab. However, despite these initiatives, Somalia is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The Somali National Army recruited and used children in armed conflict in violation of its national law during the reporting period. Children in Somalia also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Laws do not identify hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children, and child trafficking for labor and commercial sexual exploitation is not criminally prohibited. Furthermore, the government lacks a Labor Inspectorate, did not employ labor inspectors, and conducted no inspections.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, South Africa made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The President endorsed and disseminated the amended Children’s Act to prohibit persons convicted of child trafficking from working with children and the government approved the National Policy Framework on Trafficking, which includes provisions on trafficking of minors. However, children in South Africa engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging. Labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties and social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor. in addition, barriers to education remain, especially among children without proper identification documents and children with disabilities.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, South Sudan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but it was also complicit in the use of forced child labor. The government acceded to the UN CRC Optional Protocols on Armed Conflict and Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and signed the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. The South Sudan Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Commission also secured the release of 934 children from armed groups and launched several new policies, which may have an impact on child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, South Sudanis receiving an assessment of no advancement because its national army—the South Sudan People’s Defense Forces —recruited, sometimes forcibly, children to fight opposition groups. Children in South Sudan engage in other worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict and cattle herding. The Labor Inspectorate also does not have sufficient resources to conduct labor inspections and did not hold accountable perpetrators of child labor. In addition, the government has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and police continued to indiscriminately arrest and imprison children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation rather than treating them as victims.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Sri Lanka made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government worked with the ILO to develop guidelines for establishing child labor free zones and trained government officials to implement this program. In addition, the National Child Protection Authority trained 2,770 criminal law enforcement officials on the prevention of the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Sri Lanka engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. The hazardous work list is not comprehensive because it does not include domestic work. In addition, the Labor Inspectorate is not authorized to assess penalties.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Suriname made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified International Labor Organization Convention 138 concerning the minimum age for admission to employment, signed the accession to the Protocol to the Forced Labor Convention, and amended the Law on Labor for Children and Young People, raising the minimum age of work to 16 years old. In addition, the Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons presented the 2019 National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons, the government published the results of the 2017 Child Labor Survey, and created a referral mechanism between criminal law enforcement authorities and social services. However, children in Suriname engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. In addition, the compulsory education age does not reach the minimum age for employment, leaving some children more vulnerable to labor exploitation. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, São Tomé and Príncipe made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a new Labor Law which includes a list of hazardous work prohibited for children. The government also continued to contribute resources to support centers that aim to prevent child labor by keeping children in school. However, children in São Tomé and Príncipe engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Limited financial resources hamper law enforcement agencies' capacity to enforce child labor laws, as well as the funding and implementation of the National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor. Moreover, the compulsory education age does not extend to the minimum age for work and there is a lack of programs targeting children engaged in agriculture, a sector where there is evidence of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, the United Republic of Tanzania made a minimal advancement to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government made efforts by establishing a new National Child Labor policy and continuing to support the Tanzania Social Action Fund Conditional Cash Transfer Program, planning a Phase IV for launch in 2019. However, despite these initiatives to address child labor, Tanzania is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement a policy and practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Since 1984, the government has regulated access to secondary education through the Primary School Leaving Exam. Students who do not pass the exam do not have an opportunity to re-take the exam and must drop out of public school, preventing them from continuing their education. Students in Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar complete primary education at the average age of 14. Children in Zanzibar who do not pass the exam can find themselves out of formal education, but still below the minimum age for work of15, leaving them at increased risk of child labor. Although the government has expressed its intention to phase out the National Exam by 2021, it has yet to initiate efforts or make preparations to do so. The government also explicitly supports the routine expulsion of pregnant students from public schools, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Tanzania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining, quarrying, and domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain in the legal framework, including protections for child engagement in illicit activities and domestic work. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Thailand made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government trained 8,155 NGO networks working on labor rights to recognize the indicators of the worst forms of child labor; hired 394 additional labor inspectors, including Department of Labor Protection and Welfare civil servants and contractors,and22 additional interpreters at Department of Labor Protection and Welfare offices and shipping port inspection centers; and continued the information-sharing agreement with the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to combat online commercial child sexual exploitation. Further, the government continued to work directly with NGOs to open two additional Child Advocacy Centers, bringing the total to five in Thailand. Children in Thailand engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in Muay Thai fighting competitions and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet the international standard for the minimum age of work. Enforcement of child labor laws remains a challenge due to an insufficient number of inspectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Timor-Leste made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Prime Minister's Office convened different agencies to develop an implementation plan for the National Action Plan Against Human Trafficking via the Inter-Agency Trafficking Working Group. However, children in Timor-Leste engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Timor-Leste does not meet international standards related to the minimum age for work. In addition, Timor-Leste’s Penal Code and Labor Code only protect children under the age of 17, leaving children aged 17 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Also, during most of the reporting year the Government of Timor-Leste did not have an operating budget inhibiting its ability to fund programs. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Togo made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government added a toll-free texting platform to its Allo 1011 hotline and made data available in real time through an online platform that is disaggregated by type. In addition, it signed a bilateral agreement with the Government of Gabon to increase cooperation in combatting trafficking in persons and, with the support of the World Bank, provided 5.7 million school meals and constructed 80 new primary schools. However, children in Togo engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. The government has not devoted sufficient resources to combat child labor, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties for child labor violations. In addition, the government does not collect and publish data related to its efforts to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Tokelau, the government made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor in 2018.The government implemented the United Nations Pacific Strategy, which includes economic development strategies, including eliminating child labor and the worst forms of child labor. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor as the law does not criminally prohibit forced labor and child trafficking. In addition, Tokelau has not established a minimum age for work and does not prohibit hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Tonga made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a labor law complaint mechanism and it is currently in the process of ratifying the ILO Convention concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and the Worst Forms of Child Labor. However, children in Tonga engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and fishing. Gaps in the legal framework also remain; the country has no laws specifying a minimum age for work or defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation. In addition, the government has not established a policy or program to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Tunisia made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed an expanded hazardous work list that includes additional categories deemed hazardous for children, including street work among other areas; however, the list is still pending consultation with labor unions and final approval by the Minister of Social Affairs before its eventual submission to the Council of Ministers for final approval. As part of its Child Labor National Action Plan, the government also published full results of the national child labor survey conducted in 2017. Regarding enforcement, the government conducted trainings, in tandem with international organizations, on trafficking in persons legal statutes for civil and criminal law enforcement officials. It also promulgated a new National Strategy on Trafficking in Persons. Lastly, the government inaugurated the Amali Center outside of Tunis as the first facility for child victims of trafficking in persons. However, children in Tunisia engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and street work. In addition, the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are engaged in work in the informal sector on inhabited premises, such as private homes, without permission of the property owner or a court order.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Turkey made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government signed a Joint Declaration on the Elimination of Child Labor, declaring 2018 as the Year of Elimination of Child Labor. In addition, 355 labor inspectors,81 provincial directors, and 320teacherswere trained on child labor. The Integrated Model for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Seasonal Agriculture in Hazelnut Harvesting prevented 1,022 children from working in hazelnut harvesting and was extended to 2020. However, children in Turkey perform dangerous tasks in seasonal agricultural work and in small and medium manufacturing enterprises. Gaps in the labor law and uneven enforcement resulted in insufficient protection of children employed by agricultural enterprises with fewer than 50 workers. Provisions related to the minimum age for work do not meet international standards. In addition, high poverty rates and limited work opportunities for adult refugees left some Syrian refugee children vulnerable to exploitation in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2018, Tuvalu made a minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tuvalu is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Research indicates the Labor Inspectorate failed to conduct any worksite inspections for the second year in a row. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Additionally, the government has not ratified ILO C. 182. Otherwise, the government made efforts by doubling the number of labor inspectors from the previous year from two to four. Additionally, the government has continued conducting consultations throughout the country on the proposed Child Protection and Welfare law. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Tuvalu engage in child labor in fishing and domestic work. The government also has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Tuvalu lacks data to determine the prevalence and nature of child labor in the country. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Uganda made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development, in partnership with the Kampala Capital City Authority removed 283 children from the streets of Kampala and provided them with social services. The government initiated proceedings to harmonize legal provisions on minimum age to align with international standards. The government drafted a National Action Plan on Child Labor and approved the plan in February 2019. However, children in Uganda engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. The lack of a centralized supervisory authority, as well as inadequate funding, training, and resources hampered the capacity of law enforcement agencies to conduct child labor inspections and investigations. Gaps in the legal framework persist, including contradicting laws regulating the minimum age for employment. In addition, existing programs are inadequate to address child labor in the country.</Description>

    <Description>  In 2018, Ukraine made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government took steps to strengthen labor inspection by proactively planning and conducting labor inspections, including child labor inspections. In addition, it doubled its number of labor inspectors and established an Inter-Ministerial Counter-Trafficking Coordination Council. However, children in Ukraine engage in the worst forms of child labor and perform dangerous tasks in street work. National policies related to child labor continue to lack sufficient funding for effective implementation. Despite a new resolution adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers on the social protection of children in difficult living conditions, the government did not report supporting any new social programs to address the worst forms of child labor. Furthermore, Russian aggression in the east of the country continued, which negatively impacted the government’s ability to address the worst forms of child labor by limiting the budget available for social services and other domestic policy priorities and by increasing the vulnerability to exploitation of children living in Russia-controlled geographical areas.         </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Uzbekistan made moderate efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government took active measures to address the use of forced child labor in the cotton harvest, including by issuing temporary regulations for labor conditions in organized cotton picking; reiterating the legal bans on using forced labor or the labor of persons under age 18; raising the price paid to farmers for cotton; and sanctioning 169 officials for using forced labor. However, children in Uzbekistan engage in forced labor in silk production and scrap metal collection. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws prohibiting the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards, and the government did not impose penalties for violations related to the worst forms of child labor or publish labor and criminal law enforcement data. In addition, there are gaps in labor law enforcement, such as the decision by the government-sponsored Coordination Council on Child Labor and Forced Labor not to conduct its own harvest monitoring and an insufficient number of labor inspectors to cover the workforce adequately.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Vanuatu made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government reactivated the National Child Protection Working Group, which had been inactive since 2014. The Ambae volcano erupted in July, which forced more than 10,000 residents to neighboring islands. Children experienced long interruptions to their education and may be more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor due to the eruption and subsequent evacuations. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Vanuatu engage in dangerous tasks in forestry. Vanuatu’s minimum ages of 14 for work and 15 for hazardous work do not comply with international standards. In addition, the Government of Vanuatu did not respond to requests for information related to labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcement efforts related to eliminating child labor. Also, Vanuatu lacks a referral mechanism for criminal authorities to refer cases to social services for children.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, the Palestinian Authority made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the areas of the West Bank under its control. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education improved training and increased wages for teachers, and began building more classrooms and equipping them with digital facilities to improve learning at schools. The Palestinian Authority also cooperated with UNICEF and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to provide educational services to 280,000 students and emergency school supplies to over 14,700 students. However, children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in construction and illicit activities. Children also engage in child labor in street vending. The legal framework does not criminally prohibit all elements of child trafficking and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties. In addition, programs to prevent or eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Morocco, which administers an estimated 85 percent of the territory of the Western Sahara, made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published information on criminal and labor law enforcement efforts, in addition to investigating and prosecuting criminal cases. Moreover, it continued to fund the Tayssir Conditional Cash Transfer Program, providing direct cash transfers to qualifying families whose children meet school attendance criteria, reaching more than 2 million students in 2018. Limited research indicates that there is some evidence that children in Western Sahara engage in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. In addition, research also could not determine whether penalties were imposed for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. The scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>  In 2018,Yemen made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Republic of Yemen participated in UNICEF programs that provided educational and social services. However, despite initiatives to address child labor, Yemen is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement practices that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The government did not make efforts to combat chattel slavery by investigating and prosecuting cases, and it failed to make efforts to address discrimination in schools against children from the Muhamasheen community, leading to their increased vulnerability to child labor. Furthermore, there is evidence of recruitment and use of children in hostilities by state armed forces in contravention of Yemeni law. Children in Yemen engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and armed conflict. Children also engage in child labor in fishing. Due to the ongoing armed conflict, the internationally recognized Republic of Yemen government had limited operational control of its ministries in Yemen. As a result, it was unable to provide sufficient demobilization and rehabilitation services to children who have been recruited and used by various groups engaged in armed conflict, or who have engaged in other worst forms of child labor.   </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Zambia made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government developed National Action Plans on Child Labor and Anti-Human Trafficking in line with Zambia's 7thNational Development Plan. It also increased the number of inspectors from 134 in 2016 to 155 in 2018; significantly increased the number of labor inspections conducted; identified 511child labor law violations, and achieved five convictions for the crime of human trafficking. In addition, the government published studies that provide insights into child labor and child commercial sexual exploitation and included child labor for the first time in its Labor Force Survey. However, children in Zambia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. The Education Act does not specify a compulsory education age, and human trafficking laws are discordant with international standards because they require threats, the use of force, or coercion to be established for the crime of child trafficking. In addition, labor inspectors lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws. </Description>

    <Description>In 2018, Zimbabwe made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government continued to implement the Trafficking in Persons Action Plan, developed a national referral mechanism to assist victims of human trafficking, and established guidelines to improve coordination of anti-trafficking efforts. In addition, it increased budget allocations for the Basic Education Assistance Module and Harmonized Social Cash Transfer programs with the aim of reaching 500,000 vulnerable children and 60,000households, respectively. However, children continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, mining, and tobacco production. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Law enforcement agencies lack resources to enforce child labor laws. In addition, gaps remain in the country’s legal framework against child labor, such as the lack of free basic education, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor.</Description>
