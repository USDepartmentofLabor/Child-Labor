    <Description>In 2022, Afghanistan made no advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 resulted in an increase in the prevalence of child labor, including its worst forms, and exacerbated existing child labor risks for girls. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, drought conditions, and worsening economic conditions further exacerbated child labor, child marriage, and child trafficking in the country. During the reporting period, the Taliban actively recruited and used children as part of their security forces. Furthermore, authorities considered some child trafficking victims, especially those engaged in bacha bazior armed conflict, as criminals, housing them in juvenile detention centers and subjecting them to torture and other forms of ill treatment rather than referring them to victim support services. Children in Afghanistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict, forced labor in the production of bricks and carpets, and commercial sexual exploitation. The government lacks a mechanism to impose penalties for child labor violations and sufficient programs to address situations of child labor or prevent its occurrence. In addition, Afghan law does not sufficiently criminalize forced labor, debt bondage, or the commercial sexual exploitation of girls.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Albania made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The new Special Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime Court began taking cases involving human trafficking and organized crime, including cases in which children are forced to engage in criminal activities. Additionally, the government continued to support programs focused on the improvement of children's rights, including the National Agenda for the Rights of the Child and the National Strategy on Education. However, children in Albania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in illicit activities and forced begging, and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining, including chromium. In addition, Albania's legal framework governing child labor does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Algeria made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted legislation to remove the requirement of proving force, fraud, or coercion for an act to be considered child sex trafficking. The National Authority for the Protection and Promotion of Children also launched an online platform to increase coordination between civil society organizations working on child protection issues. However, children in Algeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also engage in street vending. Algerian law does not provide increased penalties for, or categorize as a separate crime, the involvement of children in either the production or trafficking of drugs. The government also has not determined by national law or regulation the types of work that are hazardous for children to perform. Moreover, while the labor inspectorate is authorized to conduct inspections in all workplaces, inspectors do not investigate some workplaces, such as houses or informal construction sites, without a complaint, resulting in instances of child labor going undetected. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Angola made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government updated its list of hazardous occupations and activities for children, establishing new prohibitions in the mining sector and work connected to industries that use toxic materials anddecreasing the daily maximum number of hours minors are allowed to work from 8 hours to 4 hours.The Ministry of Public Administration, Labor, and Social Security also conducted training workshops to build the capacity of several stakeholders working on child protection matters, and the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights heldtrainings and workshops on human trafficking concepts for members of the Angolan diplomatic corps, national police officers, prosecutors, and to all 18 provincial human rights committees. Additionally, the Multisectoral Commission on the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor established procedures to process and report child labor cases and strengthened its coordination with law enforcement and social service providers. However, children in Angola are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. Laws prohibiting forced labor are not sufficient as they do not criminalize practices similar to slavery or allow for the prosecution of debt bondage. Additionally, the number of labor inspectors is likely insufficient for the size of Angola's workforce, and social programs do not target all sectors in which  children work.    </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Anguilla, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum age of 12 for work and 14 for hazardous work does not meet international standards, and Anguilla lacks a list of prohibited hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Argentina made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government reported completing 92 targeted actions outlined in the 2020-2022 National Action Plan Against Human Trafficking and Exploitation, and for the Protection and Assistance of Victims. These actions included the implementation of the Victims' Compensation Fund and supporting 42 survivors of human trafficking. Further, the government published the National Plan for the Regularization of Labor, which included the funding allocated for its Labor Inspectorate. However, children in Argentina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the transport, sale, and distribution of drugs. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture. Moreover, the government does not publish complete information about its labor law enforcement efforts and the labor inspectorate remains understaffed to adequately address child labor issues in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Armenia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted a new Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, which strengthened Armenia’s child protection framework by criminalizing child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The government also adopted a universal inspection checklist on labor rights violations which is applicable to all industries. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Armenia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law that delays advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Labor inspectors lack full authority to conduct unannounced inspections, despite receiving additional authority in 2022 to carry out limited unannounced inspections when detecting unregistered employment cases. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Children in Armenia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. In addition, the government does not routinely collect or maintain official data on the prevalence of child labor. Furthermore, the minimum age for work does not meet international standards because labor legislation does not apply to children working in the informal sector.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Azerbaijan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased training to address human trafficking and amended the Rules of the National Referral Mechanism for Victims of Human Trafficking, to expand the Interagency Commission’s composition and to delegate implementation of the National Referral Mechanism to the Commission. In addition, the government continued efforts to integrate children with disabilities into mainstream education by establishing twelve more schools with inclusive classrooms. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it has not rescinded a law that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. In 2017, the government extended a moratorium on labor inspections, including worksite inspections, until 2021. During the reporting period, the moratorium was extended first through January 1, 2023, and again through the end of 2023. There was no indication of when onsite inspections would resume, and while inspectors can conduct desk reviews in response to complaints, this lack of proactive or onsite inspection mechanisms may leave potential violations of child labor laws undetected in workplaces. Children in Azerbaijan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. In addition, there are limited data available to indicate how many children are currently engaged in child labor. In some instances, police treat children forced to beg or engage in street work as a family issue, leading to some cases not being properly referred for criminal investigation and prosecution. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practices that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Bangladesh made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government revised the list of hazardous work to include five more sectors, including dried fish manufacturing. In addition, the Department of Inspections for Factories and Establishments rescued 3,990 children from various hazardous sectors. However, despite these initiatives to address child labor, Bangladesh is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The government of Bangladesh did not permit Rohingya refugee children to attend primary and secondary schools in Bangladesh, including private institutions, due to their lack of documentation. Additionally, the Government of Bangladesh continued its ban of all refugee-run learning and coaching centers, further hampering educational accessibility for Rohingya refugees children not enrolled in the Myanmar Curriculum. Children in Bangladesh are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in drying of fish and the production of bricks. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of garments and leather goods. The Bangladesh Labor Act provides limited protection to those working in the informal sector, where most child labor in Bangladesh occurs. In addition, penalties for child labor violations can only be imposed after a lengthy legal process and, when courts do impose them, the fines are too low to deter child labor law violations. Moreover, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts related to child labor in 2022.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Belize made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the National Child Labor Policy and Strategy 2022-2025, which aims toeliminate the worst forms of child labor by 2025 and prioritizes addressing legislative and information gaps, increasing child labor law compliance, and reducing barriers to education. The Ministry of Human Development also introduced new standard operating procedures on human trafficking and trained 85 percent of social workers, 80 percent of labor officers, and 78 percent of immigration officers on using the procedures to refer victims to care. However, children in Belize are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture and construction. Belize does not meet the international standard for prohibitions of hazardous work because children over 14 are permitted to work in dangerous activities like mining and construction. In addition, Belize has not adequately prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Benin made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Benin provided criminal law enforcement data on investigations and prosecutions concerning the worst forms of child labor for publication in this report. The government also renewed and contributed funding to the Integrated National School Feeding Program, which provides meals at 75 percent of Benin's schools. Finally, labor inspectors, social workers, and judicial police officers received training from the Generale Directorate of Labor on standard operating procedures for child labor cases. However, children in Benin are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in the production of cotton and crushed granite. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work and street vending. There are many barriers to education, especially for children with disabilities. In addition, inadequate funding for the labor inspectorate may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Bhutan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Royal Government of Bhutan ratified the Palermo Protocol and the United Nations Protocol Against Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, and Air. Additionally, the Royal Government conducted anti-trafficking training programs for 72 judges and conducted 7 awareness programs on countering human trafficking for over 2,600 students. However, children in Bhutan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work and caregiving. Bhutan’s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards, and education is not compulsory. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to address child labor, including its worst forms and the government did not publicly release information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Bolivia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The municipal government of Santa Cruz trained 300 university students to volunteer in the Market Spaces program, designed to offer programming and support to over 500 children who often work in the markets with their families. The Ministry of Labor trained 8,850 people to help prevent child and forced labor. However, children in Bolivia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the harvesting of Brazil nuts, and mining. Although Bolivian law requires that apprentices attend school, it does not set a minimum age for participation in apprenticeships. In addition, prohibitions against child trafficking are insufficient because they require the use of threats, force, or coercion to be established for the crime. The government also did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>UnwrapUnwrapnot apply to children who are self-employed or working outside of formal employment relationships, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age to work. In 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. There was a notable increase in the severity of sentences handed down by cantonal courts for the crime of trafficking children. Additionally, the Anti-Trafficking Strike Force membership was expanded by the Ministry of Security to include representation from the Service for Foreigners' Affairs. However, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Social programs dedicated to assisting children involved in forced begging do not have adequate resources, and representatives from the Ministries of Labor are not included in the National Anti-Trafficking Strike Force, which limits coordination efforts. Furthermore, as most child labor is in the informal sector, laws on the minimum age for work do not meet international standards because they do not apply to children who are self-employed or those working outside of formal employment relationships.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Botswana made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified the International Labor Organization's Labor Inspection Convention and the Labor Inspection (Agriculture) Convention, which outline mandates to promote effective labor inspection systems, including in the agricultural sector in which child labor is prevalent in the country. The Ministry of Labor also provided comprehensive information on its labor law enforcement efforts and partnered with a local NGO to conduct targeted inspections in key districts where there have been reports of child labor on commercial farms and cattle posts. However, children in Botswana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in cattle herding and domestic work. Key gaps remain in the country’s legal framework, including the lack of a minimum age for compulsory education and a list of hazardous work activities for children. The government also did not provide information on its criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. In addition, the design and implementation of social programs to address child labor are insufficient to fully address the scope of the problem, especially in commercial sexual exploitation, cattle herding, and domestic work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Brazil made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published two updates to the national "Dirty List," which contains data on employers that the Ministry of Labor and Welfare found to be using slave labor, including that of children. The updated lists were published in April and October for a total of 184 newly listed employers. The Secretariat of Labor Inspection conducted over 1,368 child labor specific operations which resulted in the removal of 2,317 children from situations of child labor and the worst forms of child labor. The number of operations and rescues were the highest recorded in the last six years. Additionally, the government launched the Information System for Confronting Human Trafficking, which aims to generate data on the purposes and forms of recruitment, improve responses in addressing these crimes, and allow for detailed information on victims of human trafficking to be recorded. During the reporting period, the Rio de Janeiro City government launched the first Municipal Plan to Combat the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, which aims to improve existing policies focused on protecting and ensuring the rights of minors, including through the increase of awareness campaigns to address and eradicate child labor and the Auxílio Brasil program reached unprecedented levels by extending assistance to over 21,5 million families. However, children in Brazil are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Although Brazil made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions against child trafficking require the use of threats, violence, coercion, fraud, or abuse to be established for the crime of child trafficking and, therefore, do not meet international labor standards. The reported number of labor inspectors is likely not sufficient to provide adequate coverage of the workforce, and local governments lack the capacity to fully implement and monitor the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor and other social protection programs.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the British Virgin Islands, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. There is no list of hazardous work prohibited for children in the British Virgin Islands, nor does the law criminalize the use of children in illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum age for work of 16 years old is lower than the compulsory education age of 17 years old.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Burkina Faso made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. On September 12, 2022, in collaboration with the UN, the government adopted a handover protocol, which considers child soldiers as victims and stipulates they must be transferred to social services by security forces if detained following military operations. The government also developed a mobile application for labor inspectors to use in carrying out their duties related to finding and removing children from dangerous or illegal work sites. Further, the National Coordination Committee for the National Strategy Plan to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labor held its first meeting, finalizing the 2021 implementation report of the National Strategy to End the Worst Forms of Child Labor; and translated the dangerous work list decree into five local languages. Lastly, the government validated the 2023–2027 Strategic Plan on Eliminating Child and Forced Labor in the Cotton, Textile, and Garment Value Chains. However, children in Burkina Faso are subjected to the worst forms of child labor,  including in farming and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in artisanal gold mining. The Labor Code does not identify the light work activities in which children may engage. The government also lacked resources for the enforcement of child labor laws and did not release information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Burma is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. During the reporting period, the regime’s military continued to force civilians, including children, to work in non-combat roles as porters, cleaners, cooks, and agricultural laborers in conflict areas. Otherwise, the government made efforts by enacting the Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons Law, which establishes that a child trafficking offense does not require a demonstration of force, fraud, or coercion. Children in Burma are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced recruitment of children for use in armed conflict by armed groups, and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The vulnerability of Rohingya children to the worst forms of child labor remained high as many continued to be denied access to education and livelihoods because of restrictions on their movements imposed by the regime. The regime also has not published a hazardous work list of activities prohibited by children, as required by the Child Rights Law. In addition, the regime did not publicly release information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Burundi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Burundian government significantly increased funding for labor inspections, a fourteen-fold increase from 2021. The government, in collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund, also developed a national strategy to increase the integration of Batwa children into schools. Furthermore, members of Burundi's newly formalized Consultation and Monitoring Commission on Prevention and Repression of Trafficking in Persons validated a new national action plan on human trafficking, pending approval from authorities and final adoption by the Office of the Prime Minister. However, children in Burundi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining.Burundi's compulsory education age, 15, is lower than its minimum age for work, 16, leaving children vulnerable to labor exploitation. The government also failed to provide comprehensive criminal law enforcement data related to the worst forms of child labor and lacked resources to conduct labor inspections and criminal investigations. Lastly, Burundi has insufficient social programs to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Cabo Verde made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The General Legal Framework for the Protection of Children and Adolescents was drafted and approved by legislators during the reporting period. The Framework contains provisions and formalizes procedures for assisting children in danger, including victims of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. The government also reported its first worst forms of child labor conviction in recent years, imposing a 10-year sentence against an individual for the prostitution of a 14 year old minor. Additionally, the government began working on a new National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and the Cabo Verdean Institute for Children and Adolescents and the National Statistics Institute conducted a survey on children, which included statistics on child labor. However, children in Cabo Verde are subjected to the worst forms of  child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Although Cabo Verde made efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, laws prohibiting forced labor are not sufficient as they do not criminalize practices similar to slavery or debt bondage and forced or compulsory labor. In addition, coordination among law enforcement agencies is limited and social programs to assist children involved in agriculture and domestic work are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Cambodia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Cambodialaunched and committed $10 million to the National Action Plan on Early Childhood Care and Development, which aims to provide equitable and inclusive early childhood education and prioritizes an expansion of early learning curriculum, improved teaching materials, and a strengthened preschool workforce.Cambodia's Inter-Ministries Technical Working Group also drafted the Child Protection Law, which outlines children's rights and provides detailed information on how officials should conduct child-centered case management and referrals to social services.Despite initiatives to address child labor, Cambodia is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to take active measures to investigate, prosecute, convict, and sentence public officials who participate in or facilitate the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation of children and debt-based forced labor in brick kilns. In addition, judges, police, and labor inspectors were reported to have accepted bribes to overlook child labor offenses in the country, especially when the perpetrator had alleged ties with the government. Children in Cambodia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced labor in brickmaking. The government also failed to publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts. Moreover, the lack of regulation in the microfinance industry has led to debt bondage and an increase in child labor.</Description>

    <Description>  In 2022, Cameroon made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Officials from the East Regional Delegate of the Ministry of Social Affairs identified 3,000 children engaged in child labor at 46 mining sites. In addition, the government inaugurated a new anti-trafficking hotline, 1503, in cooperation with the International Organization for Migration. Finally, the Government of Cameroon supported access to education by distributing 1,803,906 free textbooks to students at 13,000 primary schools and hiring an additional 3,000 primary school teachers. However, children in Cameroon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in the recruitment by non-state armed groups for use in conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cocoa production and gold mining. The government has not addressed gaps in Cameroon's legal framework regarding the prohibition of use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs, and the prohibition of the recruitment of children under age 18 by non-state armed groups. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, the Central African Republic made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed and ratified a Trafficking in Persons Law, which creates a prosecutorial framework for trafficking offenses and establishes broad protections and services for trafficking victims, regardless of their immigration status. It also established a National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Children, which includes a specific focus on preventing children from being recruited and used in conflict. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Central African Republic is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. Government security forces recruited children for support roles during the reporting period in violation of national law. The government also coordinated with an armed group that recruited and used children in armed conflict and some children accused of aiding armed groups were detained in facilities for incarcerated adults. Children in the Central African Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use in armed conflict and forced labor in diamond mining. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic work. Other gaps remain, as the Central African Republic does not meet the international standard for minimum age protections since the law does not cover children working in the informal sector.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Chad made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government collaborated with the United Nations Children's Fund and the European Union to modernize the civil registry with the aim of increasing access to birth registration. In February 2022, the government also ratified the International Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. However, children in Chad are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in domestic work and cattle herding. The government did not provide sufficient data on law enforcement efforts and does not have policies or programs to address all worst forms of child labor in the country, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Chile made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Chile passed laws that prohibit the use of children in illicit activities, raised the maximum prison sentences for those guilty of committing child trafficking crimes, and guaranteed the rights of children to be protected from economic exploitation. The Ministerial Advisory Commission for the Eradiation of Child Labor and Protection of Working Adolescents also held several meetings on inspection guidelines for the labor directorate, which resulted in the creation of a manual and training modules on child labor and migration for enforcement personnel. In addition, Chile participated in the Alliance 8.7 Strategic Workshop as a Pioneer Country to renew its roadmap for attaining sustainable development goal 8.7. However, children in Chile are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children are also subjected to involvement in the production and trafficking of drugs. The minimum working age in Chile is lower than the age for compulsory education, which may encourage children to begin working before the completion of their schooling. Furthermore, migrant children face significant barriers to education, including a lack of transportation and discrimination in educational settings.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Assessment</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>For the 2022 reporting period, no assessment has been made regarding Christmas Islands' efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because there is no evidence of a worst forms of child labor problem and the country has an adequate legal and enforcement framework on child labor. However, during the reporting period, the Work Health and Safety Act 2020 took effect, which increased protections for children 16- and 17-years old working in mines for the purposes of apprenticeships. In addition,the Government of Australia ratified the International Labor Organization Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention of 1930 and tabled for consideration in Federal Parliament the Minimum Age Convention (No. 138) of 1973.Lastly, the Government of Australia issued its annual report detailing efforts to carry out the Modern Slavery Act and continued to fund cash assistance programs.</Description>

    <Description>For the 2022 reporting period, no assessment has been made regarding Cocos (Keeling) Islands' efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because there is no evidence of a worst forms of child labor problem and the country has an adequate legal and enforcement framework on child labor. However, during the reporting period, the Work Health and Safety Act 2020 took effect, which increased protections for children 16- and 17-years old working in mines for the purposes of apprenticeships.In addition,the Government of Australia ratified the International Labor Organization Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention of 1930 and tabled for consideration in Federal Parliament the Minimum Age Convention (No. 138) of 1973.Lastly, the Government of Australia issued its annual report detailing efforts to carry out the Modern Slavery Act andcontinued to fund cash assistance programs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Colombia made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Through Law 2205 of 2022, the government amended the Code of Criminal Procedure to prioritize investigations and prosecutions in notable crimes involving child and adolescent survivors, including some of the worst forms of child labor, and created a Special Unit in the Judicial Police to develop strategies related to such crimes. The government increased the number of labor inspectors from 885 to 1,165, developed an Elite Group of Inspectors to focus on child labor, and increased the capacity of labor inspectors to identify children at risk.Through 161 child labor-related assistance activities, the government reached approximately 80 percent of the country's municipalities. Additionally, the government increased Venezuelan migrant children's enrollment in the education system by approximately 20 percent compared to the year prior. However, children in Colombia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking.In addition, inadequate resource allocation for the labor inspectorate, including an insufficient number of labor inspectors, may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Finally,existing social programs are insufficient to address the scope of the worst forms of child labor in Colombia.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Comoros made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a National Brigade for the Repression of Illegal Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons and the National Committee on the Prevention of Illegal Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons to bolster its anti-trafficking efforts. Further, it doubled the number of labor inspections carried out in 2022 compared to the previous year. However, children in Comoros are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. Comoros' Labor Code applies only to workers with a formal work agreement, leaving child laborers, particularly those in the informal sector, vulnerable to exploitation. In addition, the legal framework defines child trafficking as requiring the use of force, fraud, or coercion, which does not conform with international standards. Finally, Comoros lacks a policy that addresses all relevant worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In October, the Inter‐ministerial Commission to Combat Child Labor in Mines and Artisanal Mining Sites launched the Child Labor Monitoring System.Moreover, the Ministry of Labor hired over 2,000 inspectors, some of whom will be trained to conduct inspections in mine sites.President Felix Tshisekedi also promulgated Law No° 22/067 for the Prevention and Fight Against Trafficking in Persons, which criminalizes all forms of trafficking and prescribes stringent penalties, addressing gaps that existed in the previous legal framework. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because of the national army’s complicity in the worst forms of child labor. During the year, the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo supplied weapons and munitions to non-state armed groups known for recruiting children. Children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are also subjected other forms of the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, tin ore (cassiterite), tantalum ore (coltan), and tungsten ore (wolframite), and are used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups. Children also mine cobalt ore (heterogenite) in the Copperbelt region. The government did not publish labor or criminal law enforcement data. It also failed to take active measures to ensure that children are not inappropriately incarcerated, penalized, or physically harmed solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their exploitation in the worst forms of child labor. Other gaps remain, including a lack of sufficient numbers of enforcement personnel, insufficient training for enforcement personnel, limited financial resources, and poor coordination of government efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Republic of the Congo made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a Child Protection Action Plan, which includes measures for assisting child trafficking survivors. In addition, child labor data were published in June 2022, resulting from a nationwide study carried out by the Ministry of Social Affairs in coordination with the United Nations Children's Fund. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in carrying heavy loads. The government has yet to accede to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, and existing programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor in all relevant sectors. In addition, the country lacks a national policy to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Cook Islands, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor.  The government partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund to launch the Pacific Islands Inclusive Educational Review to ensure all children, including those with disabilities, have access to quality education. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Additionally, while the Cook Islands provides free education to citizens, permanent residents, and children of permanent residents, children outside of these categories must pay a school fee.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Costa Rica made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Roadmap to Make Costa Rica a Country Free of Child Labor and Its Worst Forms 2021–2025, with the aim to eradicate all forms of child labor in Costa Rica by 2025. However, children in Costa Rica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Furthermore, the labor inspectorate lacks a sufficient number of inspectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Côte d’Ivoire made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.The Ivoirian government conducted 9,471 inspections, a 234% increase from the previous year, and recruited 100 additional child labor agents to track instances of child labor on cocoa farms and production zones.The government also officially created the National Sustainable Cocoa Committee (Comité National du Cacao Durable, CNCD) which is designed to implement the National Strategic Plan to address deforestation, child labor, and low incomes of cocoa farmers.In addition, the governmentopened 91 new secondary schools, 517 new primary schools, and 227 new preschools during the reporting period.However, children in Côte d’Ivoire are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee. The governmentdoes not have a mechanism to assess civilpenalties for labor law violations and the lack of financial resources and personnel may have hindered labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Djibouti made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a National Committee to Fight Against Trafficking and Similar Practices and in partnership with the International Organization for Migration, established and opened the Center for Unaccompanied Children and Vulnerable Migrants, which provides mental health and medical support, legal assistance, shelter, food, and clothes to vulnerable young migrants. The Ministry of Women and Families also conducted a study on children living in the street in Djibouti City, which included information about the prevalence and conditions of forced child labor. However, children in Djibouti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in street work. Minimum age provisions apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards. In addition, the government did not make adequate efforts to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor due to lack of financial and human resource allocations and reporting mechanisms. Finally, the government did not publish data on criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Dominica, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government funded and participated in programs that may contribute to preventing child labor, including fundraising for the Education Trust Fund and providing meals to students. However, the government's ability to prevent children from being subjected to the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not determine the types of hazardous work prohibited for children and the government has not enacted laws explicitly prohibiting the use of children in pornography. In addition, information on Dominica's criminal law enforcement efforts was notpublicly released.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Dominican Republic made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor approved a resolution prohibiting the employment of children under the age of 18 in domestic work, classifying this type of work as hazardous for minors. The Metropolitan Transportation Office, the National Institute of Land Transit and Transportation, and the Ministry of Education signed an inter-institutional agreement to execute the School Transportation Program to facilitate the school access of students living in vulnerable areas by increasing their mobility. In addition, the Ministry of Education appointed 24,815 public school teachers and directors to fill out vacancies in the school system. However, children in the Dominican Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain, including limited human and financial resources for the enforcement of child labor laws, such as a lack of a sufficient number of labor inspectors and criminal investigators, and adequate facilities, transportation, and fuel. Labor inspectors also lack the authority to assess penalties for labor law violations, including those related to child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Ecuador made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Interior created the National Directorate for the Investigation of Crimes Against Women, Family, Children, Adolescents, Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling, which oversees law enforcement units responsible for investigating labor and sex trafficking cases that involve children. Further, the Ministry of Tourism approved a new Code of Conduct for tourism industry workers that includes actions meant to prevent the sexual exploitation of minors in tourist establishments. In addition, the government’s new social program, Inclusive Cities, brought protection services and temporary housing to 9,000 beneficiaries in 17 cities. However, children in Ecuador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children  also perform dangerous tasks in mining. The Ministry of Labor has reported that the resources allocated to the labor inspectorate -- including the number of inspectors, transportation, and equipment -- is insufficient to conduct inspections in the informal sector. The Government of Ecuador has also not undertaken a nationwide child labor survey since 2012; the lack of current information on the prevalence of child labor hampers efforts to address the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Egypt made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved an updated National Strategy for Combating and Preventing Trafficking in Persons, which includes outcomes related to reducing child labor. The government also provided comprehensive criminal law enforcement data for inclusion in this report for the first time, and investigated 107 crimes involving 237 individuals, initiated 171 prosecutions, and achieved 70 convictions related to the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Egypt are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in quarrying limestone. The government did not publish data on its efforts to enforce its child labor laws, including labor inspectorate resources, number of child labor violations found, and penalties imposed for child labor violations. Additionally, programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem, particularly the lack of targeted programming to prevent and child commercial sexual exploitation and limestone quarrying.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, El Salvador made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the National Assembly made reforms to Article 627, which allows for higher fines to be given for child labor violations. The Trafficking in Persons Unit of the Attorney General's Office added 6 additional prosecutors, for a total of 15 in the anti-trafficking unit. The National Council on the Trafficking of Persons also carried out trainings for hospitality and emergency service hotline workers to better identify victims of human trafficking.However, children in El Salvador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and in illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of coffee. Law enforcement agencies continue to lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws throughout the country. Gaps also remain related to the lack of publicly available, comprehensive information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Finally, social programs do not adequately address the full scope of the child labor problem in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Eritrea is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. Government officials continued to force students in grade 12, some of whom are under the age of 18, to participate in military training elements of the government's compulsory national service program. Otherwise, the government made efforts by increasing the number of its child wellbeing committees from 43 in 2021 to 67 in 2022. Children in Eritrea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced military training associated with national service, forced agricultural labor, and forced recruitment by state armed groups for use in armed conflict. In addition, Eritrea's minimum age protections do not apply to children working outside formal employment relationships and laws do not criminally prohibit the use of a child for prostitution or the procuring and offering of a child for the production of drugs. Moreover, the government does not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Eswatini made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security began conducting a review of their offices with ILO to evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts in addressing child labor. However, children in Eswatini are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, forced livestock herding, and commercial sexual exploitation. Significant gaps in the legal framework remain, including gaps in minimum age protections, a lack of legislation regulating the labor conditions under Kuhlehla and other customary practices, and a de facto compulsory education age that does not meet international standards. In addition, minimum age protections only apply to children working in industrial undertakings, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age to work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Ethiopia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government supported a study of child domestic servitude to learn how to better prevent this form of child labor. The Ministry of Labor launched the Decent Work Country Program and an action plan to address child labor and forced labor. However, children in Ethiopia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and in commercial sexual exploitation. Ethiopian law does not include free basic education or a compulsory age for education, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Also, social programs to address child labor have not sufficiently targeted to sectors with high incidences of child labor, including agriculture and domestic work. </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) also continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to prevent child labor. There is no functioning labor inspectorate in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) to enforce labor laws. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the minimum age of 14 for work and 16 for hazardous work does not meet international standards, and the law does not prohibit adults from using, procuring, and offering a child for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Fiji made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics carried out a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in 2021 and published the results in August 2022, providing new information on the prevalence of children engaged in child labor, including hazardous work. However, children in Fiji are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Fiji's light work provisions are not specific enough to prevent children from being involved in child labor. Furthermore, the government lacks social programs to provide services to children exploited in commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic work. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Gabon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government worked with the United Nations Children's Fund on a campaign to provide birth certificates to more than 10,000 children andincreased funding, bed capacity, and in-kind support for shelters. However, despite government initiatives to address child labor, Gabon is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to provide evidence it conducted worksite inspections during the reporting period. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to child labor. Children in Gabon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. Gabonese law regarding minimum age for work provisions only applies to children in formal employment relationships, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age for work. In addition, Gabon does not have a policy that addresses all relevant forms of child labor and lacks social programs to address child labor in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, The Gambia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved an Ethical Recruitment Policy Guidelines, a Pre-Departure Training Manual, and a Labor Migration Strategy to protect Gambian labor migrants, many of whom are children, from exploitation and unfair treatment. It also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Nigeria to coordinate efforts to address the trafficking of women and children. Additionally, the government launched four centers to provide services to survivors of gender-based violence and trafficking in persons, including child victims. However, children in The Gambia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging.Gaps in the law remain, including that theminimum age for work of 18 years old is higher than the compulsory education age of 16 years old. The Gambia also lacked resources to conduct adequate enforcement efforts and has insufficient social programs to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Georgia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its number of labor inspectors and the Prosecutor’s Office adopted a new strategy for 2022–2027 to increase efforts to identify and effectively prosecute child trafficking and labor exploitation through a victim-centered approach. The government also approved a new National Strategy for the Protection of Human Rights in Georgia for 2022–2030, with a focus on protection of the rights of certain vulnerable groups, including children, and a new eight-year strategy to ensure equal access to education for all children in Georgia. However, children in Georgia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced begging. Children also engage in agricultural labor. Although the government made meaningful efforts in some relevant areas during the reporting period, Georgia's minimum age for work does not meet international standards because it does not apply to the informal sector. In addition, the Criminal Code does not explicitly prohibit the use of children in illicit activities. Furthermore, lack of coordination between the entities involved in addressing human trafficking hinders efforts to adequately assist child victims.</Description>

In addition, the government improved its data sharing efforts with NGOs and other countries by providing timely responses to requests for information. However, children in Ghana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in fishing and cocoa production. Prohibitions related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards because, while Ghana does criminally prohibit the use, procuring, and offering of a child for electronic performances, the law does not extend to live performances. The law also does not prohibit the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the government has not acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. Lastly, resource constraints severely limited the government's ability to adequately enforce labor laws and implement social programs during the reporting period.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Grenada, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government's ability to prevent children from being subjected to the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws require the use of force, threats, abuse of power, or other forms of coercion, and therefore do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking. Grenada has also not identified activities prohibited for children orcriminally prohibitedthe use, procuring, or offering of a child for all forms of commercial sexual exploitation.In addition, the government has not published data on labor inspectorate funding.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guatemala made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted a decree amending the penal code to include crimes committed against children and adolescents through the use of technological means. The Labor Inspectorate also expanded its specialized group of inspectors for human rights, including child labor issues, from 4 to 11 inspectors. The government also relaunched the "Protecting our Greatest Treasure" media campaign to raise awareness on protecting children and adolescents from sexual exploitation and human trafficking in the tourism sector. However, children in Guatemala are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. An insufficient number of labor inspectorslimits the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare's ability to address child labor. In addition, existing social programs are insufficient to reach all children engaged in exploitative labor and, in particular, do not target children engaged in domestic work or agriculture.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guinea made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government substantially increased the budget of the labor inspectorate and the number of labor inspections conducted, compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the government opened shelters for trafficking survivors, including child survivors, in Conakry and N’Zérékoré, with support from the European Union and Expertise France. However, children in Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in artisanal mining and forced begging. The government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. Laws related to the minimum age for work also do not meet international standards because they do not include children working outside of a formal employment relationship and children who are self-employed. In addition, the government does not implement sufficient social programs to address the extent of the child labor problem. On September 5, 2021, the military launched a coup, seized control of the state, and dissolved the Constitution. The coup and the resulting changes in government likely impacted the ability of the Government of Guinea to fully engage in addressing the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guinea-Bissau made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Guard began training border officials on how to detect human trafficking situations and created grass roots committees within villages near border locations to aid in identifying human traffickers using illegal border crossings. The newly developed case management and referral system, under the lead of the National Institute for Women and Children, was also used by 28 institutions during the reporting period and although the National Emergency Plan for the Prevention and Combat of Trafficking in Persons expired in 2021, it continued to be implemented and contributed toward the rescue and reintegration of 198 child trafficking victims at the national and transnational level. However, children in Guinea-Bissau are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Prohibitions against the commercial sexual exploitation of children does not meet international standards since the prostitution of children is not criminally prohibited in the country's legal framework. In addition, even though a new labor code was put into effect in 2022, the minimum age for work remains not in compliance with international standards since the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children without a work contract. Furthermore, law enforcement officials do not receive sufficient resources to adequately conduct inspections and prosecute cases of child labor, and social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Guyana made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Guyana increased the amount given to families through student cash vouchers. However, children in Guyana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Guyana does not meet the international standard for hazardous work for children because it allows children ages 16 to 17 to conduct night work in industrial activities.Guyanese law does not sufficiently prohibit all commercial sexual exploitation of children because it does not prohibit the use of children for prostitution.In addition, law enforcement agencies have insufficient resources to conduct inspections in remote areas, including a lack of transportation and accommodation. The government did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Haiti made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government certified 29 new labor inspectors and trained them on the labor vulnerabilities faced by children living in orphanages and working in the informal sector. Additionally, with the support of UNICEF the government created a new coordination mechanism dedicated to child protection issues.However, children in Haiti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and domestic work. Minimum age protections for work apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards requiring all children to be protected. In addition, Haiti lacks a clear minimum age for domestic work and a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. Likewise, social programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Honduras made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Commission for the Gradual and Progressive Eradication of Child Labor updated the hazardous work list, which awaits ministerial approval, and held a public expo to raise awareness of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security also approved the creation of a child labor seal to incentivize the private sector to implement good practices and promote compliance with child labor prohibitions. In addition, the government replaced the Better Life Voucher program with the Solidarity Network conditional cash transfer program for families in some of the poorest towns in the country to ensure those children stay in school. However, children in Honduras are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. They are also used to carry out illicit activities, including selling and trafficking drugs. Children also engage in child labor in the production of coffee, melons, and lobsters. Labor law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandates, identifying no child labor law violations in 2022 and decreasing the number of criminal investigations conducted and prosecutions initiated compared with the previous reporting period. Additionally, social programs that aim to address child labor in agriculture have failed to address the problem, and other social programs are needed to address child labor in fishing, mining, domestic work, and forced begging.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, India made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Railway Protection Force started a nationwide campaign that helped rescue 183 children from trafficking. In Haryana, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit reunited 378 trafficked children with their families, and the police department rescued 1,760 children from child labor. Additionally, the Government of India revised the rehabilitation scheme for bonded laborers, which increased the immediate financial assistance provided to survivors from $250 to $375. However, children in India are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in garment production, stone quarrying, and brickmaking. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work for long periods in unsafe and unhealthy environments, and penalties for employing children are insufficient to deter violations. There are also serious concerns about widespread corruption among police and other government officials related to the enforcement of child labor crimes, actively impeding the investigation and prosecution of such offenses, and mistreating victims. In addition, children continue to be abused in shelter homes that operate without sufficient government oversight or accountability.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Indonesia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection, together with UNICEF, launched the Prevention of Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse program, a three-year partnership in response to a report on Indonesian children being victims of online sexual exploitation. The Ministry of Manpower also increased funding for the labor inspectorate from $12.2 million in 2021 to $15.1 million in 2022, and increased its number of labor inspectors by 267, for a total of 1,570. However, children in Indonesia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in plantation agriculture, including in palm oil and tobacco production. Despite the increases in funding and inspectors in 2022, the Ministry of Manpower continues to lack the financial resources and personnel necessary to fully enforce child labor laws throughout the country. In addition, Indonesia's prohibitions against child trafficking are inconsistent with international law because the Law on the Eradication of the Criminal Act of Trafficking in Persons requires a demonstration of threats, the use of force, or coercion be established for the crime of child trafficking to have occurred.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Iraq made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs' Child Labor Unit conducted 328 inspections throughout the country. Additionally, the unit identified 109 children under 15 engaging in child labor and 604 under 18. However, Iraq is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. During the reporting period, Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government authorities inappropriately detained or punished children allegedly affiliated with ISIS—some of whom were victims of forcible recruitment and use. Children in Iraq are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. The government did not provide information on its criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. It also continues to lack social programs that focus on assisting children involved in child labor, such as commercial sexual exploitation, brickmaking, and child soldiering.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Jamaica made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security drafted a new government policy aimed at reducing child labor, that is awaiting Cabinet approval. However, children in Jamaica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and use in illicit activities. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and street work. Jamaican laws do not provide higher penalties for using, procuring, or offering children for the production and distribution of drugs than penalties imposed for these same crimes when the victims are adults. Moreover, thelaw providing for free basic education does not meet international standards because free education is only guaranteed for Jamaicancitizens.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Jordan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the penal code to increase penalties for enabling or encouraging a child under the age of 16 to beg or collect donations, including imprisonment of not less than two years for forced child begging. The government also investigated42 cases involving the use of children in the production and trafficking of drugs andupdated the National Framework for the Reduction of Child Labor, extending it to 2030. However, children in Jordan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Moreover, Syrian children still face barriers to accessing education due to socioeconomic pressures, bullying, and the costs associated with transportation and supplies, among other issues. In addition, the scope of government programs is insufficient to fully address the extent of child labor, including in construction and street vending.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Kazakhstan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government provided data on labor inspectorate funding for the first time since 2020, and increased that funding significantly. Training for labor inspectors was provided and new courses were introduced specifically to target the identification and remediation of the worst forms of child labor, including child trafficking. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Kazakhstan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued with the implementation of the revised Entrepreneurial Code that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. On December 30, 2021, the President of Kazakhstan signed a law significantly restricting the circumstances under which unannounced inspections can be performed. The new law, which came into effect on January 1, 2023, codifies and expands the government’s existing practice under which unannounced inspections are prohibited in all cases, except in the presence of compelling grounds, and supporting evidence enclosed to such a complaint, or if an inspection is mandated by judicial or tax authorities. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. Children in Kazakhstan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in markets. The government lacks current, comprehensive, and detailed research on child labor, including in cotton production. In addition, the government extended a moratorium under which labor inspections of small enterprises are permitted only in cases that pose a mass threat to life and health, law and social order, or national security.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Kenya made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government enacted the Children's Act, strengthening legal protections for children from child labor and outlining child protection mandates of government agencies. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Kenya is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Elements within the Kenyan Defense Forces provided various forms of in-kind support--including harboring, training, intelligence-gathering, and payment of salaries--to a Somali federal member state that is strongly implicated in the recruitment and use of child soldiers. Children in Kenya are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic service. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Key coordinating committees related to the elimination of child labor lack adequate resources to carry out their mandates and the labor inspectorate does not have sufficient financial and human resources, affecting its ability to ensure that child labor laws are enforced.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Kiribati made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2022, the Ministry of Women, Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs launched a child protection case management and referral system called SafeNet, which allows personnel from the government, churches, and NGOs to share information and assist child victims, including those found in exploitive situations. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Kiribati are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Existing laws do not identify hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children. The law also does not specify the conditions under which light work can be undertaken. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Kosovo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government adopted a new Law on Crime Victim Compensation, which will expand the existing victims' compensation program and thereby assist child victims of human trafficking and forced labor. Additionally, the new Strategy for Advancement of the Rights of Roma and Ashkali Communities 2022–2024 was adopted.The government also worked with Save the Children to develop manuals for social services providers, which resulted in improved communication between providers in efforts to assist vulnerable children. However, children in Kosovo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work, including begging and loading and transporting goods. The Labor Inspectorate and Centers for Social Work face financial and human resource constraints, which may impede their ability to adequately address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Kyrgyz Republic made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In January 2022, a moratorium on labor inspections expired and the Ministry of Labor, Social Security, and Migration resumed regular inspections. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also continued to conduct raids of business at high risk for labor law violations, including raids specifically targeted towards identifying vulnerable children and child labor. The criminal code was amended to strengthen penalties for sexual abuse of children or involving children in illicit activities. In addition, the government funded the construction and staffing of 31 new schools to improve educational access. The government did not provide complete information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. However, children in the Kyrgyz Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Protections to children granted in the Labor Code, such as the minimum age of employment, are not extended to children engaged in non-contractual employment, and research indicated that labor law enforcement efforts are not targeted to all sectors in which children are vulnerable to child labor, especially agriculture. In addition, the scope of social programs to address child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Lebanon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.In June 2022, the United Nations Children's Fund expanded a national grant for children calledHaddi. The program provides cash assistance to children at risk of child labor and child marriage, and to children with disabilities, children in non-formal education, and children needing nutrition support. However, children in Lebanon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced labor in agriculture. Children also engage in child labor in the production of potatoes and tobacco. Furthermore, government officials continued to indicate that funding is insufficient to properly carry out their duties. In addition, Lebanese law prohibits inspectors from inspecting informal workplaces, where the majority of child labor occurs, and social programs targeting child labor remained insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Lesotho made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Lesotho organized 17 radio programs and 39 school seminars with a focus on human traffickingand finalized a report with recommendations on how to improve the criminal justice systems response to human trafficking. The government also placed additional officers at the Moshoeshoe International Airport to help identify human trafficking victims and theLesotho Police Forces rescued four girls from being trafficked.However, children in Lesotho are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in animal herding. Lesotho’s compulsory education age is 13 which is below the minimum age for work, which is 15, leaving children in between these ages vulnerable to child labor. The government also lacks effective coordination mechanisms to address child labor, and labor inspections are not conducted in high-risk sectors, including the informal sector, where child labor is prevalent.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Liberia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government signed a new hazardous work list, which identified specific occupations and tasks prohibited for children, including sugarcane cleaning and harvesting, rubber tapping, palm cutting, bush clearing, and harvesting cocoa.The government also almost doubledthe number of labor inspections it conducted from 556 in 2021 to 1,044 in 2022.Finally, the government design standard operating procedure to guide the operations of Liberia's child labor monitoring systems at the district level. However, children in Liberia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of rubber and the mining of gold and diamonds. Liberia has yet to accede to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict or the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. Moreover, social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Madagascar made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a new National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons and the Regional Committee in the Fight Against Child Labor of Fianarantsoa conducted field visits to markets, brickmaking sites, and stone quarries to monitor child labor and raise awareness among parents. In 2022, for the first time in several years, the Ministry of Labor also compiled reports from 11 of its regional offices on child labor related activities between 2019 and 2021, which identified 922 children working in various sectors. Finally, the government expanded daily school meals from roughly 1,200 to 2,209 public primary schools. Although Madagascar made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, the government failed to investigate reports of some officials accepting bribes to produce and issue false identity documents to facilitate commercial sexual exploitation of minors. Children in Madagascar are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the mica mining sector and in agriculture, including in the production of vanilla. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor, and Madagascar does not have a current national action plan for the elimination of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Malawi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Criminal law enforcement officials increased the number of convictions related to the worst forms of child labor and participated in ten trainings on laws protecting children from child labor. In addition, Malawi's Ministry of Labor began piloting a Child Labor Monitoring System to enhance data collection, identification of working children through attendance data, and improved coordination within the tobacco sector. However, children in Malawi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in the harvesting of tobacco and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Minimum age laws do not meet international standards because protections do not extend to children working in private homes and on non-commercial farms. The government did not provide information on its criminal law enforcement efforts related to the worst forms of child labor for inclusion in this report. Moreover, gaps continue to exist in labor law enforcement related to child labor, including insufficient financial resource allocation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Maldives made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the number of labor inspections from 124 inspections in 2021 to 656 in 2022. It also increased the budget for labor inspections and the number of labor inspectors from 23 to 32. Moreover, the government began conducting a baseline study on trafficking in persons throughout the country's atolls. However, children in Maldives are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, illicit activities, and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Information on children's work is limited because a national survey on child labor has not been conducted. Laws in Maldives also do not sufficiently prohibit commercial sexual exploitation because the use, procurement, and offering of a child for pornographic performances are not criminally prohibited. In addition, criminal enforcement agencies did not publish statistics on the number of investigations conducted, prosecutions initiated, convictions achieved, and penalties imposed for violations related to child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Mali made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government recruited an additional three labor inspectors. However, despite this initiative to address child labor, Mali is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continues to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The government used children in its armed forces during the reporting period in violation of national law. Children in Mali are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in the production of cotton and rice, and in artisanal gold mining. Although Mali's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Law criminalizes trafficking for the purpose of slavery, it does not more broadly criminalize the act of slavery. Malian law also does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering of children for illicit activities, and allows children under the age of 18 to be penalized for acts they were forced to commit as a direct result of being recruited and used by armed groups. In addition, Mali lacks a national action plan to address all worst forms of child labor that exist in the country, and social and rehabilitation services remain inadequate for child labor victims.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Mauritania made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In February 2023, the government created the Instance Nationale, an organization mandated to combat hereditary slavery and human trafficking by coordinating cross-government efforts, cooperating with international partners, providing assistance to victims, maintaining a database of trafficking cases, and working with civil society organizations. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mauritania is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a policy and a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Although there were indications of progress, criminal law enforcement authorities did not make adequate efforts to address slavery and its vestiges during the reporting period. In addition, since 2011, the government has required proof of marriage and biological parents’ citizenship for children to obtain a birth certificate. As a result, children born out of wedlock and many Haratine and sub-Saharan ethnic minority children, including those of slave descent, have been prevented from being registered at birth. Because birth certificates are required for enrollment in secondary school in Mauritania, children as young as age 12 cannot access education, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mauritania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary slavery. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in herding cattle and goats. In 2022, the government did not make sufficient efforts to enforce some of its laws related to child labor, including laws on hereditary slavery. Furthermore, social programs to address child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem, and the government did not publish comprehensive information about its labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Mauritius made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In January 2022, the government enacted three laws, the Children's Act 2020, the Children's Court Act 2020, and the Child Sex Offenders Register Act 2020, aimed at reinforcing the legal framework on the protection of children. The three laws intended to harmonize Mauritius' domestic laws with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. The government also increased its number of labor inspectors from 109 in 2021 to 164 in 2022 and formally approved a National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, with support from the International Organization of Migration. However, children in Mauritius are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, including selling drugs. Children also engage in child labor in construction and street work. Barriers to education access, including conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic and rising inflation, place children in Mauritius at greater risk of child labor. In addition, gaps remain in the implementation of key policies and social programs related to child labor, including the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Mexico made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government expanded various mechanisms to address child labor, such as by increasing the number of municipal-level bodies that are part of the the National Network of Local Inter-Institutional Commissions for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor and the Protection of Adolescent Workers of Permitted Age in Mexico. It also approved the ratification of the International Labor Organization Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention (1930). In addition, the Benito Juárez Wellbeing National Scholarship Program reached 1.2 million more students in 2022 than in 2021. However, children in Mexico are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of chile peppers, coffee, sugarcane, and tomatoes. Although nearly 55 percent of all employment in Mexico occurs in the informal sector, federal and some state-level labor inspectors carry out inspections in that sector only after receiving formal complaints. Further, the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare does not have an internal system to track cases of child labor violations. Additionally, the 529 labor inspectors in the country are likely insufficient to cover the country's more than 57 million workers. Criminal law enforcement agencies responsible for conducting investigations into cases of the worst forms of child labor lacked human and financial resources to operate effectively against crime and the existing culture of impunity for perpetrators. Finally, the government published only limited information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>           In 2022, Moldova made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. On December 22, 2022, Moldova's Parliament passed a law which newly empowers the State Labor Inspectorate to conduct unannounced visits to worksites known or suspected to use undeclared work or labor exploitation. Although new legislation reduced the number of labor inspectors which can be hired to the State Labor Inspectorate, funding for the inspectorate increased and the reduced number of positions is intended to increase inspector salaries and retention. Moldova also reactivated the National Council on the Protection of the Rights of Children, enacted a new National Program for Child Protection, and signed a joint order between three ministries approving new child welfare observation and assessment reports and an action planning report for primary prevention of child welfare risks. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, Moldova does not meet the international standard for minimum age for work because the Labor Code's minimum age provisions do not apply to all children working in the informal sector. Children in Moldova are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Child labor-specific training is needed for labor inspectors, and entities responsible for conducting labor inspections, including of hazardous child labor, lack adequate funding, personnel, and equipment. In addition, there is a lack of social programs to address child trafficking and child labor in agriculture.  </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Mongolia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Mongolia's revised Labor Law went into effect on January 1, 2022 and includes a formal prohibition of child labor exploitation and sets the minimum age for work at age 15. The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia also published a qualitative study on child labor with support from the International Labor Organization. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mongolia is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it implemented a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that Mongolia lacks a functioning labor inspectorate for the enforcement of labor laws and regulations as it dissolved its labor inspectorate in November 2022. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mongolia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in horse jockeying andmining, including for coal, fluorspar, and gold.Lastly, due to a lack of training and formalized screening procedures, criminal law enforcement officials sometimes detain child victims of prostitution rather than referring them to social services.   </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Montenegro made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Montenegro continued to support the work of the Council for the Rights of the Child, and also increased cash benefit payments to families with children at risk for child labor. Additionally, the government allocated funding for the construction of the country's first shelter dedicated to children who are survivors of human trafficking. However, children in Montenegro are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, research found that the scope of programs to address child labor in street work is insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Montserrat, in 2022, the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Montserrat also continued to implement a law that delays advancement to prevent the worst forms of child labor.Labor inspectors do not have the authority to conduct unannounced inspections, as they must obtain either the business owner's consent or a search warrant in order to enter a business for the purposes of performing an inspection. The lack of unannounced inspections may leave potential violations of child labor laws and other labor abuses undetected in workplaces. In addition, the Labor Code allows children as young as age 14 to engage in light work; however, Montserrat does not have a list of activities that constitute light work, nor does it specify the conditions under which light work may be undertaken or limit the number of hours for light work. Additionally, the government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children norcriminally prohibited the use of children for illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government convicted five civil servants on charges related to child commercial sexual exploitation or forced labor. It drafted a national strategy against human trafficking that includes efforts to better identify victims and improve victim services. It also developed a guide for use by a wide variety of government ministries to aid in the identification of trafficking victims and conducted trainings to inform the development of a referral mechanism for victim services. A national anti-trafficking strategy was enacted in March 2023, which includes the enhanced referral mechanisms for victims of trafficking needing social services. Additionally, the government increased the number of labor inspectors by over 23 percent. However, children in Morocco are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work. Moroccan law on the minimum age for work does not meet international standards, as children 15 years of age and under are not protected when working in traditional artisan and handicraft sectors. Furthermore, the scope of government social programs that target child labor is insufficient. For example, current programs do not fully address children exploited through domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Mozambique made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In April of 2022, the government convened its first annual National Conference on the Elimination of Child Labor, and subsequently held eight province-level conferences on child labor and trafficking. Additionally, it held awareness campaigns about child labor and child labor trafficking in informal markets, schools, religious sites and communities in all provinces. Furthermore, the government trained judicial officials on the worst forms of child labor prevention framework, as well as several other trainings for border officials on child labor and trafficking in persons. Children engage in dangerous tasks in the production of tobacco. In addition, the established minimum age for work is not in compliance with international labor standards because it does not extend to informal employment. Lastly, existing social programs are insufficient to fully address the extent of the child labor problem in Mozambique.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Namibia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In March, the government launched the Social Protection Policy to provide a framework to strengthen existing protection mechanisms, including the Child Disability Grant and the Orphans and Vulnerable Children Grant, both of which provide monthly supplemental payments to children vulnerable to child labor. However, children in Namibia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in agricultural work, domestic work, and street work. Prevention and elimination of child labor are not integrated into key national policies, and social programs do not address child labor in agriculture and domestic work. The government also did not publish data on labor law or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Nepal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government announced the liberation of the Haruwa-Charuwa agricultural bonded laborers, estimated to be over 120,000 adults and children in forced labor. The Ministry of Labor increased the funding to its inspectorate from $5,710 to $15,720 and increased the number of inspections conducted from 1,830 to 2,544. In addition, the Nepal Child Rights Council provided protection assistance to 11,696  children across 47 districts through 417 children homes. However, children in Nepal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in producing bricks. Nepal's law related to child trafficking is insufficient because it does not clearly criminalize recruitment, harboring, receipt, or transportation in the absence of force, fraud, or coercion, and the law prohibiting the use of children in illicit activities is insufficient because it does not prohibit the use of children in the production of drugs. The Department of Labor’s budget, the number of labor inspectors, and available resources and training for inspectors are also insufficient for enforcing labor laws, including those related to child labor. Furthermore, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Niger made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the governmentcreated an interministerial committee to combat forced begging and held a workshop to revise the National Action Plan to Combat Child Labor. However, children in Niger are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and mining, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks herding livestock.  The minimum age for work does not meet international standards because it does not apply to children in unpaid or non-contractual work. In addition, the government made no efforts to address the ongoing practice of wahaya, a form of child slavery that was upheld as illegal by a Nigerien court in 2019. Lastly, gaps in labor law enforcement also remain, including insufficient funding for labor inspectors to conduct inspections.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Nigeria made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period,the government hired over 180 labor officers to throughout the country and increased inspections from 10,526 to 17,026. The government also established eleven Community Child Labour Monitoring Committees (CCLMC) which oversee child labor projects and outreach efforts and adopted the National Action Plan on Human Trafficking in Nigeria: 2022–2026 which provides a framework for mobilizing the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons and Other Related Matters (NAPTIP) and all stakeholders involved in addressing human trafficking. Finally, the government conducted a national child labor survey in order to better inform their child labor policies. However, children in Nigeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and use in armed conflict, as well as quarrying granite and artisanal mining. The Child's Right Act has been adopted by only 34 out of Nigeria's 36 states (including the capital federal territory), leaving the remaining 2 states in northern Nigeria with legal statutes that do not meet international standards for the prohibition of children in illicit activities. In addition, the minimum age for work does not apply to children who are self-employed or working in the informal economy.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Niue, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund to launch the Pacific Islands Inclusive Educational Review to ensure all children, including those with disabilities, have access to quality education. However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Niue has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found that no child labor exists on Norfolk Island, in 2022, the government made moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Government of Australia ratified the International Labor Organization Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention of 1930 and tabled for consideration in Federal Parliament the Minimum Age Convention (No. 138) of 1973. Additionally, the Government of Norfolk Island began transitioning its states' services from New South Wales to Queensland, which is expected to fully complete by December 31, 2026. Only specific legislation is in force during this transition. Due to this transition, Norfolk Islands has not established a minimum age for hazardous work nor identified a hazardous work list for children. In addition, Norfolk Islands does not meet the prohibition of commercial sexual exploitation of children because it does not prohibit the use, offering, or procuring of children for prostitution. Lastly, as the minimum age for work, 15, is lower than the compulsory education age, 16, children may be encouraged to leave school before the completion of compulsory education.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, North Macedonia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government supported policies and social programs that assisted children vulnerable to labor abuses, and the Ministry of Education and Science continued implementing new guidance on proper accommodation of students with disabilities. Additionally, investigators from the Ministry of the Interior received trainings related to child labor and juvenile justice from the Academy for Judges and Prosecutors. However, children in North Macedonia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. The law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships. Additionally, the government has not adopted a policy to address all worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Oman made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking launched a new website in English and Arabic with information on how to report human trafficking crimes in 14 languages. Additionally, in cooperation with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the government drafted a new law to address human trafficking. There is evidence that small numbers of children in Oman engage in child labor, including in fishing and farming. Research is needed on the extent and nature of child labor to inform policies and programs. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Pakistan mademoderate advancementin efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Pakistan's federal and some provincial governments amended existing laws to better address worst forms of child labor, including increased punishment for offenders involved in child sexual abuse, trafficking, and pornography, protection of child domestic workers, and punishment for parents and guardians pledging children for labor. The Punjab Labor Department conducted over 6,000 inspections at brick kilns, identified 239 child labor violations, and made 60 arrests of those suspected of using child labor, while the Federal Investigation Agency made arrests related to child pornography. Lastly, the Sindh government created a Child Protection Task Force to review all laws related to child labor in the province and recommend amendments to fill gaps in current legislation. However, children in Pakistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work, brick manufacturing, and agriculture. Pakistan's labor inspectorates do not have sufficient human and financial resources to adequately enforce laws prohibiting child labor, and the federal and provincial governments did not publicly release information on their labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Furthermore, police corruption, particularly the taking of bribes from suspected perpetrators to ignore child labor crimes and a lack of willingness to conduct criminal investigations, hindered Pakistan's ability to address child labor throughout the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Panama made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Panama increased the number of labor inspectors in their country from 105 to 198. In February, Panama passed Law 285, creating the System of Guarantees and Rights for the Integral Protection of Children. This law established regulations on protections relating to commercial sexual exploitation, economic exploitation, and hazardous work. The law also established pecuniary penalties, suspension, and closure of commercial premises for companies that have been found to use child labor. The Committee for the Eradication of Child Labor and the Protection of Adolescent Workers created new sub-committees for the provinces of Chiriquí, Herrera, Panama East, and Panama West. In addition to these new sub-committees, the Committee for the Eradication of Child Labor and the Protection of Adolescent Workers adopted two new technical procedures on safety and prevention of hazardous work. However, children in Panama are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Panamanian law allows minors under age 16 to engage in hazardous work within training facilities in violation of international standards. Moreover, labor law enforcement agencies lack the financial and human resources necessary to fulfill their mandates. Finally, existing social programs are insufficient to address the full scope of the child labor problem in the country, in particular for children living in rural areas and from indigenous and Afro-Panamanian communities. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Papua New Guinea made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government reintroduced the Tuition Fee-Free Subsidy Policy, which pledges to cover 100% of school fees for students. However, children in Papua New Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining and deep-sea fishing. Papua New Guinea's hazardous work prohibitions do not comply with international standards because it allows children ages 16 and older to engage in hazardous work, which is below the international standard of 18 years old. Papua New Guinea also does not have laws thatsufficiently protect children from commercial sexual exploitation, because using, procuring, and offering a child for pornographic performances are not criminally prohibited nor does it haveprohibitions against child trafficking are insufficient because they require that threats, the use of force, or coercion be established for the crime of child trafficking.Moreover, although exact funding levels are unknown, the labor inspectorate does not have sufficient resources to adequately enforce Papua New Guinea's labor laws, including sufficient trainings for labor inspectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Paraguay made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created nine new committees to address child labor at the regional level and passed the National Plan for Childhood and Adolescence 2022–2024, which focuses government efforts to protect children and promote their rights, highlighting child labor as particular violations to the rights of children. In addition, the Public Ministry increased the number of prosecutions initiated of alleged child labor crimes from 47 in 2021 to 69 in 2022.  However, children in Paraguay are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic servitude and in debt bondage in cattle raising, on dairy farms, and in charcoal factories. Children with disabilities as well as those from rural and indigenous communities face difficulties accessing and completing their education. In addition, law enforcement agencies lack the funding and resources needed to sufficiently identify, investigate, and prosecute child labor crimes. Social programs also lack the funding and coverage needed to address child labor in rural areas.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Peru made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The country managed to publish a list of hazardous activities for adolescents and harsher sanctions to help prevent and report cases of commercial sexual exploitation as result of human trafficking. However, political instability, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent economic conditions in 2020 and 2021 presented challenges to the government's efforts in Peru. Children in Peru are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Peruvian law allows children ages 12 to 14 to do light work without specifying the activities in which children may work. Labor law enforcement agencies in Peru also lack sufficient inspectors and training to adequately address child labor, and the government did not provide complete information on labor law and criminal enforcement efforts against child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Philippines made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, which holds private sector entities responsible for addressing human trafficking. In July, it further focused its efforts on addressing online exploitation of children by enacting the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials Act, which, among other things, punishes online sexual abuse of children and penalizes the production, distribution, possession, and access to child sexual abuse or exploitation materials. In addition, the government launched the Basic Education Development Plan  to improve its quality and delivery of education, address access gaps, and build resilience of learners. Children in the Philippines are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and gold mining. The minimum age for work in the Philippines does not meet international standards because it is lower than the compulsory education age, making children vulnerable to child labor. Social programs have not sufficiently addressed child victims of online sexual exploitation, and enforcement of child labor laws remained a challenge throughout the country due to limited personnel and financial resources.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Rwanda made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased the labor inspectorate funding and conducted awareness raising campaigns aimed at ending child labor and child abuse and addressing human trafficking. However, children in Rwanda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining, including carrying heavy loads. Reports indicate that government officials have detained children subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and forced street begging in transit centers intended for individuals demonstrating so-called deviant behaviors, in which children often experience physical abuse. In addition, inadequate resource allocation for the labor inspectorate, including an insufficient number of labor inspectors, may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Finally, social programs do not address all relevant sectors in which child labor is present.    </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha, in 2022, the  government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child  labor. In 2022, the Government of Ascension enacted the Employment Ordinance, which details the conditions under which children may work, including acceptable work activities and hours. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha lacks a functioning labor inspectorate for the enforcement of labor laws and regulations. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha lacks legislation to criminally prohibitforced labor, debt bondage, slavery, and child trafficking.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Saint Lucia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government renewed its Trafficking in Persons National Action Plan through 2026 and launched a new Border Control Management System that will assist authorities in identifying trafficking in persons cases. In addition, Saint Lucia finalized terms for a $6.2 million dollar grant from the European Union to support a comprehensive skills training system for unemployed youth and vulnerable groups. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Lucia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in the sale and distribution of drugs. Saint Lucia's legal framework does not sufficiently prohibit the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the use of children in illicit activities. In addition, policies addressing all forms of child labor, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, do not exist.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The governmentpassed amendments to the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act to strengthen penalties for offenders. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines engage in child labor in agriculture and street vending, including selling fruits and vegetables at local farmers' markets. Gaps remain in the legal framework, as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines does not fully meet international standards because the use of children for prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances is not prohibited. In addition, the minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards and there is no legislation prohibiting the using, procuring, and offering of children in illicit activities, including in the production of drugs. The government also did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Samoa made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In partnership with the International Labor Organization, the government conducted a Rapid Assessment Survey of Child Vendors, finding a 27 percent increase compared to the same study conducted in 2015. It also provided information on its labor law and criminal law enforcement efforts, including the number of labor inspectors, for the first time for inclusion in this report. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Samoa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in street work, including begging and vending. Samoa lacks laws that prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Furthermore, as the minimum age for work of 15 is lower than the compulsory education age of 16, children in Samoa may be encouraged to leave school before the completion of compulsory education.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, São Tomé and Príncipe made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.The government continued to fund three centers run by NGOs that assist vulnerable families, orphans, and children living and working on the street. However, children in São Tomé and Príncipe are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Labor Code does not apply to children working outside of a formal labor relationship, such as children who are self-employed. Moreover, limited financial resources hampered law enforcement efforts, and policies addressing the worst forms of child labor do not exist.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Senegal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, it developed and validated new standard operating procedures on the identification, investigation, and referral of trafficking in person cases. In an effort to prevent forced begging, it also spent $603,000 to assist over 10,934 children in Koranic schools, or daaras, that met basic standards of care and child protection. Finally, it coordinated with the international partners in the launch of the Programs to Counter Sex Trafficking in Kédougou. However, children in Senegal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include domestic work or street work, areas in which there is evidence of potential harm to child workers. In addition, Senegal does not have a current national action plan or a national coordinating body for the elimination of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Serbia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Government institutions reported improvements in identifying minor victims of trafficking, including identification of socioeconomic factors often associated with a higher risk for becoming a victim of trafficking, and labor law enforcement authorities continued to receive training related to assisting populations that are vulnerable to economic exploitation. Additionally, the Government of Serbia approved the 2022 Plan to Protect Street Children in Situations of Violence, Neglect, and Exploitation, which increases the level of collaboration among government agencies and external stakeholders such as educational institutions in efforts to address child labor. However, children in Serbia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Serbia's laws do not treat forced child beggars as victims of child labor, and the country's social welfare centers are overburdened, which limits efforts to provide services to victims of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Sierra Leone made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed the Anti-Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling Act, which raised prison terms for sex trafficking and established a trust fund for victims of human trafficking to pay for shelter, medical services, and legal aid. The government also launched a hotline to report trafficking crimes and established a National Migration Policy to promote the rights of migrants and increase public awareness of human trafficking. However, children in Sierra Leone are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in mining. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in quarrying stone and fishing. Sierra Leone'slight work provisionsdo not specify the activities and conditionsin which light work may be undertaken or limit the number of hours of light work, which does not meet international standards.In addition, Sierra Leone lacks a national policy and social program to address all relevant worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Solomon Islands made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of the Solomon Islands conducted a national survey on the state of inclusive education and launched a new National Education Action Plan (2022-2026). However, children in the Solomon Islands are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Research shows that children are also involved in the harvesting of palm oil fruits. In addition, the minimum age for work of 12 years does not meet the international standard of 14 years, and the Solomon Islands has not established a minimum age for hazardous work or delineated the types of work considered hazardous for children.Furthermore,there is no law that makes education compulsory, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor. The government also did not publish labor and criminal law enforcement data for the reporting year.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Somalia is receiving an assessment of no advancement.TheSomali police force participated in trainings conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime with the goal of increasing anti-trafficking efforts.Somaliland, which has self-declared independence from Somalia, passed an anti-trafficking in persons law.Despite these initiatives to address child labor, Somalia is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. During the reporting period, there is evidence that federal and state security forces continued to recruit and use children in armed conflict, in violation of national law. In other cases, government security forces detained children for suspected association with armed groups, at times subjecting them to lengthy interrogations and coerced confessions. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. It is unknown if the government conducted worksite inspections in 2022. Somali laws do not criminally prohibit child labor trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, or the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, South Africa made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. South Africa hosted the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labor, where delegates adopted the Durban Call to Action on Elimination of Child Labor. In addition, in August, the Department of Employment and Labor led a joint multi-departmental inspection effort that resulted in criminal child labor charges. The government also increased the benefit of the Child Support Grant by 4.3 percent and the Foster Care Grant by 1.9 percent, both of which provide direct cash transfers to reduce child vulnerability. However, children in South Africa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, forced begging, and use in illicit activities. Social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor, and free basic education is not guaranteed by law.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, South Sudan is receiving an assessment of no advancement.The government made efforts by extending until 2024 the Comprehensive Action Plan to Prevent All Grave Violations Against Children in South Sudan. In addition, for the first time since the pandemic in 2020, the Ministry of Labor conducted labor inspections, and, in collaboration with Save the Children and the United Nations Children’s Fund, the government published the Education Needs Assessment South Sudan 2021.Despite these initiatives to address child labor, South Sudan is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated complicity in the use of forced child labor. The country's military forces continued to recruit children, sometimes forcibly, to fight opposition groups and for use in support roles. Children in South Sudan are also subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in cattle herding. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. In 2022, the government did not hold perpetrators of child labor accountable and has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Sri Lanka made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government amended the Children and Young Persons Ordinance to raise the age of majority from 16 to 18 to align this law with international standards. The Department of Labor also expanded its Child Labor-Free Zone model, a program to identify and financially support children engaged in child labor, to four additional districts throughout the country. In addition, the Children and Women’s Bureau of the Sri Lankan Police conducted an exercise to identify street children engaged in begging in four locations, which resulted in those children being referred to appropriate social services. Moreover, the government worked with the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund to implement a $34 million campaign to support children's school attendance, nutrition, and safety in response to the economic crisis. However, children in Sri Lanka are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Research indicates that some children in rural areas face barriers to accessing education, including difficulties in traveling to school, an inadequate number of teachers, and challenges with registration for migrant children. Furthermore, the labor inspectorate lacked sufficient staffing and funding to carry out an adequate number of inspections, including in factories in the northern and eastern provinces.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Suriname made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Commission on Combating Child Labor translated television and radio programs into six languages and held awareness sessions on child labor. The government also increased the number of convictions it secured for child labor crimes andsigned bilateral and regional enforcement arrangements with French Guiana, Brazil, and Guyana that included language on joint efforts to combat cross border criminal activities, including human trafficking. In addition, the government launched a program toprovide inclusive access to all levels of education, with a specific focus on children in the interior and improving the quality of lower secondary education.However, children in Suriname are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining.  The compulsory education age does not reach the minimum age for employment, leaving some children vulnerable to labor exploitation. In addition, Suriname's laws do not criminally prohibit the use of a child under 16 for prostitution. The government did not report the number of child labor inspections it conducted.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the United Republic of Tanzania made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period the Mainland government made available, for the first time in several years, complete information on its labor law efforts, identifying 74 child labor violations through 4,800 worksite inspections. The government also created a new task force to enhance efforts to prevent and respond to human trafficking offenses, including those that relate to children, and allocated financial resources to support its National Strategy on Elimination of Child Labor. However, children in Tanzania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in mining, quarrying, and domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain in the legal framework and enforcement of laws related to child labor, including protections for the use of children in illicit activities and domestic work and likely insufficient number of labor inspectors to monitor Tanzania's labor force. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Thailand made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government amended the Anti-Money Laundering Act to allow for assets seized from human trafficking offenders to be used as financial remedies for survivors of trafficking, including children who were sexually exploited. In addition, it established the Child Sexual Exploitation Crime Center to help facilitate investigations of offenses related to child pornographic materials. The government also established the Migrant Education Coordination Center to coordinate with Migrant Learning Centers on education, protection, and health of migrant children. Moreover, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports initiated the Child Friendly Tourism project by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with 21 government agencies, private sector organizations, and non-governmental organizations to develop measures to reduce human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children in the tourism sector. Finally, the government drafted and approved the fifth National Policy and Plan to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2023–2027) in coordination with relevant public and private organizations across government and civil society. However, children in Thailand are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet the international standard for the minimum age for work because the law does not grant protections to children working outside of formal employment relationships. Moreover, there is a lack of available research and data on the prevalence of child labor in high-risk sectors, such as agriculture, garment manufacturing, domestic work, and construction.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Timor-Leste made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government increased funding for the labor inspectorate, finalized a national anti-trafficking action plan, established a child protection network, and completed a quantitative labor survey. However, despite these new initiatives to address child labor, Timor-Leste is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that some school principals forced pregnant girls to leave school, making them more vulnerable to involvement in child labor, including its worst forms. Children in Timor-Leste are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in street vending and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Although Timor-Leste law provides for criminal penalties for the worst forms of child labor, there is a lack of authorization for labor inspection agencies to inspect or enforce labor standards in the informal agriculture and commercial sectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Togo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Savanes Emergency Plan, which by strengthening education access and social welfare in the areas of the north affected by violent extremism, also addresses poverty, conflict, and lack of educational access as root causes of child labor. In addition, the Safety Nets and Basic Services project provided meals to school children in vulnerable communities and expanded unconditional cash transfers to 83,681 program participants. Finally, Togo eliminated fees for birth certificates, which may improve access to education and other social services. However, children in Togo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. The government has not devoted sufficient resources to allow the labor inspectorate to conduct inspections in all sectors and fully enforce the law. In addition, hazardous work regulations are insufficient because they allow children as young as 15 to perform some types of hazardous tasks, including carrying heavy loads. Finally, the government does not publish data related to its criminal enforcement efforts with regard to laws on the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Tokelau, in 2022, the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government partnered with the United Nations Child's Fund to launch the Pacific Region Inclusive Education Review to ensure all children, including those with disabilities, have access to quality education.However, the government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Tokelau has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Tonga made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched its Future-Ready Children program to expand remote learning opportunities for students and support the drafting of a child protection policy. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tonga is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Research indicates that Tonga lacks a functioning labor inspectorate for the enforcement of labor laws and regulations. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. CChildren in Tonga are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in farming and fishing. There are no laws specifying a minimum age for work, defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, or prohibiting the use of children for the production and trafficking of drugs, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation. In addition, the government has not established a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Tunisia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In September 2022, the government enacted a new law to address child sexual exploitation in the production of pornography. It also launched a digital platform to improve coordination among agencies who respond to child abuse, including child labor, and opened two new schools to help students who had dropped out of school reintegrate back into education or job skills training. However, children in Tunisia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and begging. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. The budget for staffing and logistics, such as for fuel and transportation, is inadequate to carry out inspections, especially in remote areas of the country. In addition, the government was unable to provide complete data on its law enforcement efforts due to delays in the digitization of court records.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Tuvalu made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Advisory Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child worked on developing a child protection policy for schools.However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Tuvalu engage in child labor in fishing and domestic work. The government has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Tuvalu lacks information on labor law and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Uganda made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government secured seven convictions for crimes related to child trafficking for labor purposes. The National Steering Committee on the Elimination of Child Labor approved a child labor inspection checklist and the 2021 Baseline Survey on child labor in the rice and sugarcane growing areas in Eastern Uganda. Additionally, a National Child Focused Research Agenda (2022-2026) was launched during the reporting period. The Research Agenda enables relevant research to support evidence based programing and includes research questions on child labor. However, children in Uganda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. The lack of a centralized supervisory authority along with inadequate funding, training, and resources hampered the capacity of law enforcement agencies to conduct child labor inspections and investigations. In addition, the law only guarantees free education through the primary level, which does not meet the international standard that free basic education through lower secondary school be guaranteed by law.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Ukraine made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Russia’s war on Ukraine may have impacted the government’s ability to address the worst forms of child labor throughout the country. In March 2022, the government established the Coordination Headquarters for the Protection of the Rights of the Child in Conditions of Martial Law to coordinate the temporary domestic and international evacuation of Ukrainian children living in various government institutions in areas affected by Russia's war on Ukraine. In addition, the government increased its child trafficking prevention efforts at national and local levels, to include sharing counter-trafficking information with refugees at the border crossing points. The government worked to bring back Ukrainian children who were unlawfully transferred or deported to Russia by Russia’s forces.However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Ukraine is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to prohibitunannouncedlabor inspections. Ukrainian laws do not meet international standards for the prohibition of commercialized sexual exploitation because they do not criminalize the users of prostitution involving children. In addition, the government has not published labor and criminal law enforcement information. Children in Ukraine are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of pornography. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. In addition, it remains unclear how Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine will continue to affect the child labor situation throughout the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Uzbekistan made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In October 2022, the Uzbek president signed a new labor code which places additional restrictions on work that can be performed by children. The government also issueda decree to reduce informal work and worked with the International Labor Organization to conduct a comprehensive survey of working conditions in the construction sector. In addition, it opened a new employment center in Tashkent that provides vocational skills training, as well as education on local and foreign labor laws, including to youth, women, and individuals with disabilities. Additionally, the National Commission on Combating Trafficking in Persons and Forced Labor adopted action plans to implement U.S. government recommendations on child labor and trafficking in persons. In December 2022, the President announced a government reorganization, effective January 1, 2023, in which the Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations was renamed the Ministry of Employment and Poverty Reduction and absorbed other responsibilities related to social welfare, which were previously under other ministries. However, children in Uzbekistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and public works. While the government has made strong progress in addressing labor issues in the cotton harvest, there continue to be impediments to the operation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in addressing broader labor concerns. Human rights NGOs and civil society organizations, including those working on forced and child labor issues, are frequently denied official registration for bureaucratic reasons, sometimes for failing to meet registration requirements that had not been publicly specified.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Vanuatu made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund to launch several child protection programs, including establishing a free, 24/7 child helpline to connect callers with trained child protection offices to report concerns. Additionally, the National Child Protection Referral Pathway guidance document was released, which outlined the roles of different stakeholders and service providers to provide support to children, including psychosocial support. Lastly, the government streamlined the issuance of national identification cards for children. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Vanuatu are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced domestic work. Children also perform dangerous tasks in forestry and logging sectors. Vanuatu’s minimum age for hazardous work, 15, is below the international standard of 18. Vanuatu also lacks a referral mechanism between criminal authorities and social services providers.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, the Palestinian Authority made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the areas of the West Bank under its control. In 2022, the labor inspectorate detected 360 more violations of child labor laws than in 2021 and courts achieved 9 convictions for child labor crimes. However, children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction and fishing. The Palestinian Authority’s legal framework does not establish child trafficking or forced labor as a criminal offense in accordance with international standards. Labor investigators also reported that they cannot inspect worksites at night, when they suspect child labor occurs, because of insufficient funding for overtime. In addition, social programs to prevent or eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kingdom of Morocco claims the territory of Western Sahara and administers the area that it controls with the same constitution, laws, and structures as in internationally recognized Morocco, including laws that deal with child labor. The Moroccan government developed a guide for use by a wide variety of government ministries to aid in the identification of trafficking victims and conducted trainings to inform the development of a referral mechanism for victim services. A national anti-trafficking strategy was enacted in March 2023, which includes enhanced referral mechanisms for victims of trafficking needing social services. However, children in Western Sahara are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. The law on minimum age for work does not meet international standards, as children 15 years of age and under are not protected when working in traditional artisan and handicraft sectors. Furthermore, the scope of government social programs that target child labor is insufficient. For example, current programs do not fully address children exploited through domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Yemen made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2022, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor conducted four inspections based on complaints. However, despite this initiative, Yemen is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor. There is evidence of recruitment and use of children in hostilities by state armed forces in contravention of Yemeni law. Furthermore, the government failed to make efforts to address discrimination in schools against children from the Muhamasheen (“marginalized”) community, leading to their increased vulnerability to child labor. Children in Yemen are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and use in armed conflict, including by Houthi insurgent forces (also known as Ansar Allah) and other armed groups. Children also perform dangerous tasks in fishing. Research found no evidence of a government policy on worst forms of child labor outside of child soldiering. Moreover, the Republic of Yemen government continued to have limited operational control over its ministries and was unable to enforce regulations to address child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2022, Zambia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government updated its Trafficking In Persons Act, removing the requirement that force, fraud, and other forms of coercion be demonstrated to establish a child trafficking crime, andlaunched the National Human Trafficking and Smuggling of Migrants and the National Migrant Policy, which include strategies to protect Zambian and migrant children from human trafficking and labor exploitation. In addition, the government recruited 30,000 new teachers, deploying them to rural areas where vulnerabilities to child labor are the highest.  However, children in Zambia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in agriculture. The Education Act does not specify a compulsory education age. In addition, labor inspectors do not routinely inspect non-registered businesses in which child labor is known to occur.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2022, Zimbabwe made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government worked with NGOs to carry out research, coordination, and compliance investigations targeting the tea, tobacco, and other sectors where there is high prevalence of child labor. In addition, the government substantially expanded the Harmonized Social Cash Transfer Program and the Basic Education Assistance Module, which provide livelihood and educational assistance to families that have high vulnerability to child labor. However, Zimbabwe is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it implemented a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Evidenced by a pattern of threats and intimidation of worker organizations and trade unionists, high-level officials within the Government of Zimbabwe and the ruling political party interfered with a delegation representing worker and civil society organizations to investigate concerns of child labor occurring at a commercial farm, sending party activists to the farm to threaten and intimidate the delegation. Children in Zimbabwe are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and forced labor in mines and on farms. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the harvesting of sugarcane and tobacco. The government did not publicly release information on its law enforcement activities for inclusion in this report, and law enforcement agencies lack resources to enforce child labor laws.</Description>
