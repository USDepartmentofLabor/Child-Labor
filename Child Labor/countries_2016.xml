    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Afghanistan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Security Council approved a National Anti-Trafficking in Persons Action Plan, which mandates steps to eliminate the criminal practice of bacha bazi—a form of commercial sexual exploitation of boys—by those in positions of power. In addition, it achieved its first indictment of a government employee, a school headmaster, for bacha bazi crimes uncovered in investigations of the Logar province school system in 2019 and 2020. This indictment, along with numerous other prosecutions, convictions, and stringent prison sentences achieved during the year, are indicative of a nascent shift away from a culture of impunity toward one of greater accountability for these crimes. Furthermore, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs established 10 new Child Protection Action Network units, and Child Protection Units within the Afghan National Police recruitment centers operated in all provinces. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Afghanistan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. In 2020, the government arrested, detained, and prosecuted children for terrorism-related crimes, including some younger than age 12, who had been forcibly recruited by non-state armed groups. Furthermore, authorities considered some child trafficking victims, especially those engaged in bacha bazi or armed conflict, as criminals, housing them in juvenile detention centers and subjecting them to torture and other forms of ill treatment rather than referring them to victim support services. Children in Afghanistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, armed conflict, and forced labor in the production of bricks and carpets, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Afghanistan’s labor inspectorate is not authorized to impose penalties for child labor violations, and the government lacks sufficient programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Afghan law does not sufficiently criminalize forced labor, debt bondage, or the commercial sexual exploitation of girls.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Albania made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Ministry of Justice launched the Integrated System of Data on Justice for Children, which will allow parties throughout the national justice system to coordinate on cases related to children in conflict with the law, including child labor. The government also adopted a new National Cybersecurity Plan to address the online exploitation of children, and the State Agency for the Protections and Rights of Children engaged extensively with private sector stakeholders to raise awareness of child labor and promote coordination with local government authorities. However, children in Albania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, criminal activity, and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children in Albania are also subjected to mining, including of chromium. The law does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities. In addition, the labor inspectorate lacks resources to conduct inspections in all sectors in which child labor is known to occur. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Algeria made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government increased its number of labor inspectors from 645 in 2019 to 885 in 2020 and implemented a new strategy to address forced child begging by conducting periodic visits to transportation hubs and storage facilities. In an effort to address the challenge of enforcing labor laws in the informal economy, the government also led an initiative with an Algerian think tank to explore ways to reach children involved in informal work. However, children in Algeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street vending. The government has not sufficiently prohibited the use of children in illicit activities or determined by national law or regulation the types of work that are hazardous for children to perform.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Angola made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved a consolidation of existing legislation related to child labor, including hazardous labor and child trafficking, which was incorporated into the Penal Code. In addition, the government increased the number of labor inspectors in the country by over 140 inspectors and conducted an intensive campaign to increase birth registration and the issuance of identification cards, resulting in the registration of 1,098,694 Angolans. However, children in Angola are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction. Prohibitions against the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards because they do not prohibit the procuring or offering of a child for the production of pornography or the use, procuring, or offering of a child for pornographic performances. Moreover, a coordinating mechanism dedicated solely to addressing issues related to the worst forms of child labor does not exist outside the scope of human trafficking, and social programs do not target all sectors in which children work.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Anguilla, in 2020 the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not prohibit the involvement of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum ages for work and hazardous work do not meet international standards, and Anguilla lacks a list of prohibited hazardous occupations and activities for children. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Argentina made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Buenos Aires Ministry of Labor issued a regulation to close a loophole that enabled companies to exploit underage workers through sub-contracting arrangements. Whereas the government previously did not actively investigate the use of children in illicit activities, during the reporting period gang members were convicted and sentenced for using children to sell drugs. TheCoordinating Body for the Prevention of Child Labor and Regulation of Adolescent Workwas also elevated to directorate level within the Ministry of Labor, granting it more resources and responsibilities. In addition, Argentina renewed key policies aimed at addressing the worst forms of child labor, including its biannual plan against human trafficking. Finally, the government provided additional assistance to vulnerable families during the COVID-19 pandemic through its largest social program benefiting children at risk of child labor. However, children in Argentina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the transport, sale, and distribution of drugs. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture. Moreover, the government does not publish complete information about its labor law enforcement efforts and the labor inspectorate remains understaffed to adequately address child labor issues in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Armenia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Beginning in April 2020, the Health and Labor Inspection Body took on some inspection responsibilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including enforcing quarantine provisions and ensuring worker safety and health. The government's National Action Plan Against Trafficking in Persons also went into effect in June, and implementation in several areas began immediately. In addition, the government adopted a new referral mechanism to provide assistance to minor victims of trafficking in persons. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Armenia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Although some labor inspections resumed in 2020, labor inspectors still lack the authority to conduct unannounced inspections. Children in Armenia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, and no government programs exist to aid them.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Azerbaijan made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved the National Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (2020–2024) and drafted criteria for resuming risk-based routine labor inspections on occupational safety and health. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a law that delays advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In 2017, the government extended a moratorium on labor inspections, including worksite inspections, until 2021. On March 9, 2021, this moratorium was extended again, through January 1, 2022. While inspectors can conduct desk reviews in response to complaints, the lack of proactive or onsite inspection mechanisms may leave potential violations of child labor laws undetected in workplaces. Children in Azerbaijan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Coordinating bodies, including the State Committee on Family, Women and Children's Affairs, lack the capacity to effectively carry out their mandates. In addition, police typically treat children begging or engaging in street work as a family issue, rather than screening for indicators of forced begging. As a result, cases may not be properly referred for criminal investigation and prosecution. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Bangladesh made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government extended implementation of the National Plan of Action on the Elimination of Child Labor from 2021 to 2025. The Ministry of Labor and Employment also drafted an update to the hazardous work list, which if adopted, would add drying fish. In addition, the government constituted and funded seven anti-trafficking in persons tribunals to handle human trafficking cases. However, children in Bangladesh are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced child labor in the production of dried fish and bricks. Children also perform dangerous tasks in garment and leather goods supply chains. The Bangladesh Labor Act does not apply to the informal sector, in which most child labor in Bangladesh occurs. Labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties and, when courts do impose them, the fines are too low to deter child labor law violations. Moreover, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts related to child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Belize made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Child Labor Committee, along with its affiliates, validated the Protocol for Accompanied and Unaccompanied Minors, which outlines steps a labor inspector should take if one comes across a child laborer during an inspection. Moreover, the Terms of Reference for the new National Child Labor Policy were completed, but they have not yet been formalized in new legislation or regulation. Children in Belize are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture and construction. With the exception of some work categories that allow employment at age 14, the country's minimum age for work is 12 and does not meet international standards. In addition, the country lacks prohibitions against the use of children in illicit activities and does not appear to have programs to address child labor in agriculture, fisheries, or construction.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Benin made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The labor inspectorate nearly tripled the number of inspections conducted over the previous year, and the government passed legislation increasing the minimum age for apprenticeships from age 14 to 15. Moreover, the National Monitoring and Coordination Working Group for Child Protection met for the first time since 2017. However, children in Benin are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of cotton and crushed granite, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work and street vending. There are many barriers to education, especially for children with disabilities. In addition, the government did not publicly release information on some of its criminal law enforcement efforts, and limited resources for the adequate enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Bhutan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Bhutanese Parliament passed the Penal Code (Amendment) Act of Bhutan 2021, which amended the legal definition of human trafficking to make the legislation consistent with international standards for adults, but it still includes the necessity of force, fraud, or coercion in child trafficking cases. The National Commission for Women and Children developed an internal Child Safeguarding and Protection Policy to promote and protect children from abuse and exploitation. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Bhutan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Bhutan’s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards, and education is not compulsory. The government has not adopted a national policy to address child labor, including its worst forms. The government did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Bolivia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved a resolution allowing Venezuelan minors without identification documents or with expired documents to regularize their immigration status, enabling them to access the educational system. The Office of Women and Family in the municipality of Tarija began a project with the Ministry of Labor to create a list of children working in the streets and reintegrate this population into their families and schools. In addition, the Attorney General announced the formation of department-level special prosecutor offices dedicated to pursuing crimes of human trafficking and smuggling and installing special prosecutors with greater knowledge of these crimes. Finally, under the Juancito Pinto Program, more than 2.3 million participating students received $73 million in aid to encourage school retention in primary and secondary schools. However, children in Bolivia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and mining. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of sugarcane. Although Bolivian law requires that apprentices attend school, it does not set a minimum age for participation in apprenticeships. In addition, Article 1 of Supreme Decree No. 1875 sets the minimum age for compulsory military service at 17 years, which does not comply with international standards. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Bosnia and Herzegovina made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Council of Ministers adopted the 2020–2023 National Strategy to Combat Trafficking in Persons as well as the National Action Plan to combat trafficking. The Republika Srpska entity has adopted an anti-trafficking action plan, and cantonal governments have adopted several local action plans. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina improved victim access to social services by merging resources for domestic and foreign victims of human trafficking into one fund. The Republika Srpska entity amended the chapter on crimes against citizens’ rights and freedoms in the Criminal Code by introducing forced begging, domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation as forms of trafficking to make trafficking prosecutions easier. It also strengthened sentences, which now mandate 3 to 20 years of imprisonment. However, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Border police officers and social workers failed to properly identify unaccompanied migrant and refugee children as potential victims of human trafficking due to a lack of proper protocols. Furthermore, laws on the minimum age for work do not meet international standards because they do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside of formal employment relationships.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Botswana made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government provided emergency food assistance packages to vulnerable families, reaching over 47,000 households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Criminal law enforcement officials also initiated two prosecutions related to the human trafficking of children for commercial sexual exploitation. However, children in Botswana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, cattle herding, and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Key gaps remain in the country’s legal framework, including the lack of a minimum age for compulsory education and list of hazardous work activities for children. In addition, social programs do not always reach intended child labor victims, especially those engaged in cattle herding and domestic work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Brazil made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published two updated versions of the national "Dirty List" containing information on employers that the Ministry of Economy had found to be using slave labor, including that of children. The Labor Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Highway Police, and the Brazilian Association for the Defense of Women, Children, and Youth signed an agreement to incorporate human trafficking issues in the Mapear Project, which maps points along Brazil's federal highways that are high risk for the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. Moreover, the National Commission for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor was re-established after its dismantlement in 2019, and the government approved a constitutional amendment to increase support for the Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education and the Appreciation of Teaching Professionals, with the aim of leveling the amount spent per student, per year, across the country. The government also secured a $1 billion loan for Bolsa Família to provide benefits to 3 million more participants, including 990,000 children. However, children in Brazil are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Although Brazil made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, prohibitions against child trafficking require the use of threats, violence, coercion, fraud, or abuse to be established for the crime of child trafficking and, therefore, do not meet international labor standards. Furthermore, the reported number of labor inspectors is likely not sufficient to provide adequate coverage of the workforce, and local governments lack the capacity to fully implement and monitor the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor and other social protection programs.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the British Virgin Islands, in 2020 the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The British Virgin Islands does not have a list of hazardous work prohibited for children and does not prohibit the use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the minimum age for work is lower than the compulsory education age.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Burkina Faso made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. With the support of UNICEF programs, 1,993 children who were victims of child labor and its worst forms received care and services following their removal from work in artisanal gold mining. The government also created a National Coordination Committee to enact the 2019–2023 National Strategy to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labor, and it continued to carry out a new National Survey on Child Labor. However, children in Burkina Faso are subjected to the worst forms of child labor,  including in farming and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in artisanal gold mining. The Labor Code does not identify the activities in which children may engage in light work. The government also lacked resources for the enforcement of child labor laws and did not release information on its criminal and labor enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Burma is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite limited initiatives to address child labor, Burma is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated a practice of being complicit in the use of forced child labor in more than isolated incidents. The military continued to work with international organizations to end recruitment of children for combat roles and implement a policy of releasing child soldiers. Despite this, the national military continued to force civilians, including the use of at least 700 children, to work in non-combat roles as porters, cleaners, cooks, and agricultural laborers in the conflict areas of Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan States during the reporting period. Otherwise, the government made efforts by ratifying ILO C.138, implementing the National Complaints Mechanism for Forced Labor, and approving the National Action Plan on Preventing Grievous Injuries and Sexual Abuse on Children in Armed Conflicts (2020–2021). Children in Burma are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The vulnerability of Rohingya children to the worst forms of child labor remained high as many continued to be denied access to education and livelihoods through government restrictions on their movement. Penalties for recruitment and use of children by the military or for the military’s use of civilian populations for forced labor are not sufficient for the seriousness of the crime, and the government did not publish information on criminal law enforcement efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict cases involving many of the worst forms of child labor. On February 1, 2021, the Burma military launched a coup and seized control of the state. The return of a military regime and the resulting instability may severely impact the ability of the Government of Burma to fully engage in combating the worst forms of child labor throughout the country. However, the findings in this report relate to the reporting period of January–December 2020 and do not cover the potential impacts of the military coup.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Burundi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a new labor code that made important progress in bringing Burundi's legal framework in line with international standards, such as raising the minimum age for work to age 16 and the minimum age for light work to age 15. Law enforcement authorities also implemented stringent measures to monitor the travel of unaccompanied children and identify cases of child trafficking. Meanwhile, the government launched two new programs to improve counter-trafficking capacity in Burundi and provide work alternatives to youth vulnerable to exploitation. However, children in Burundi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Burundi lacks a compulsory education age that is equal to the minimum age for work and the government failed to provide comprehensive criminal law enforcement data related to the worst forms of child labor. Other challenges remain, including a lack of resources to conduct labor inspections and criminal investigations; a lack of well-trained educators and infrastructure in the education sector; and insufficient social programs to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Cabo Verde made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Assembly approved a draft law on Crimes of Aggression and Sexual Abuse Against Children and Adolescents, which increases penalties for sexual assault, including in cases of commercial sexual exploitation, sexting, and child sex tourism. The Observatory for Monitoring and Rapid Identification of Situations of Trafficking in Persons also developed internal procedures and a list of priorities related to human trafficking, including child trafficking. Furthermore, the government extended compulsory, tuition-free education through the 12th grade. However, children in Cabo Verde are subjected to the worst forms of  child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Law enforcement officials often lack the necessary resources to conduct thorough investigations, and communication among enforcement agencies is limited. In addition, social programs to assist children involved in agriculture and domestic work are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Cambodia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed new prakas—ministry-level regulations—creating an annual public service fee for enterprises in specific sectors that will pay for announced inspections by the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training in 2021. In an effort to address the rapid increase of cases related to the online sexual exploitation of children in the country, the Cambodian National Council for Children created a working group to strengthen local governance and provide parents information on how to monitor their child's online activity. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Cambodia is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued practices that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to take active measures to investigate, prosecute, convict, and sentence public officials who participate in or facilitate the worst forms of child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation of children and debt-based forced labor in brick kilns. In addition, judges were reported to have accepted bribes in return for dismissal of charges, acquittal, and reduced sentencing for individuals committing such crimes, especially for those with alleged ties to the government; this made children more vulnerable to child labor. Children in Cambodia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced labor in brickmaking. Insufficient resources hamper the labor inspectorate's capacity to enforce child labor laws, especially in rural areas where a majority of child laborers work. In addition, continuing challenges in accessing basic education and the absence of a compulsory education requirement increase children's vulnerability to involvement in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Cameroon made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified the UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. Cameroonian police also arrested members of an international trafficking network that operated in Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Chad. In addition, the Forever Chocolate program, which provides school kits and livelihood support to families as a means to combat child labor in the production of cocoa, was expanded to Nkondjock, Sangmelima, Mbalmayo, and Ayos. However, children in Cameroon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in cocoa production. In addition, the government has not prohibited the use of children in illicit activities, including in the production and trafficking of drugs, and it has not prohibited the recruitment of children under age 18 by non-state armed groups. Furthermore, labor inspectors do not regularly conduct inspections in the informal sector, in which the majority of child labor occurs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, the Central African Republic made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In addition to publishing data on labor inspections, child labor violations, and funding, the Central African Republic's Ministry of Labor doubled the size of its labor inspectorate in 2020. The government also began to implement an expansive child protection code, and expanded mechanisms to coordinate anti-trafficking and other child protection efforts. However, children in the Central African Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use in armed conflict by non-state armed groups and in diamond mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic work. Additionally, the Central African Republic does not meet the international standard for minimum age protections since it does not include children working in the informal sector. Moreover, an estimated 1.3 million children lacked access to education because of ongoing instability.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Chad made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Chad adopted a law extending fundamental protections to Chad's refugees and asylum seekers, including the right to access healthcare and education. The government also adopted Ordinance No. 002-PR-2020, which organizes a biometric population registry for births, marriages, and divorces. Lastly, Chad hosted a national workshop to develop a 2021–2026 nationwide school feeding program action plan. However, children in Chad are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in cattle herding and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, the government did not provide clear data on law enforcement efforts and has no active policies to address child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Chile made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government published Law 21.271, which amended the Labor Code to require that a new list of hazardous activities and occupations for children and adolescents be published by the government, and ratified the International Labor Organization's 2014 Forced Labor Protocol. In addition, the National Prosecutor's Office organized multiple trainings for prosecutors and public health officials related to the protection of rights of child victims of sexual exploitation. The government also established the Tacna-Arica Bi-regional Roundtable to coordinate efforts between the Governments of Chile and Peru to prevent and eradicate child labor in the border area. Under the National Strategy for the Eradication of Child Labor and Protection of Adolescent Workers, the government held conferences, virtual seminars, trainings, and lectures dedicated to fighting child labor. Finally, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare published the results of the Child Labor Vulnerability Index, which was designed to measure child labor vulnerability across Chile's 16 regions. However, children in Chile are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also subjected to involvement in the production and trafficking of drugs. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, existing prohibitions related to forced labor do not meet international standards because forced labor is criminally prohibited only when it results from human trafficking. Furthermore, prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Colombia made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In early 2021, the government issued a decree that granted a 10-year Temporary Protective Status to the 1.7 million Venezuelans living in Colombia, providing them access to formal work, healthcare, and education for children. The Ministry of Labor conducted trainings for new and veteran inspectors and the Colombian Institute for Family Well-Being coordinated the "Pact for Growth and Employment Generation in Agro-Industrial Sugarcane," a public-private roundtable that addresses the protection of child rights, including preventing child labor. The Inter-Agency Committee to Combat Trafficking in Persons also completed its evaluation of the 2018 national action plan and launched the new National Strategy for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons (2020–2024). Furthermore, the government launched a new program, "Generacion Sacúdete," which worked with 28,096 children and adolescents in 898 municipalities across 31 departments to help develop life goals. However, children in Colombia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government does not employ a sufficient number of labor inspectors. Research also indicates that existing social programs are insufficient to address the scope of the worst forms of child labor in Colombia.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Comoros made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.  The government passed a new penal code that criminalizes child trafficking, forced labor, and hazardous child labor. It also raised its compulsory education age to 16, in line with international standards. In addition, Comoros reactivated its anti-trafficking task force and developed a new anti-trafficking action plan. However, children in Comoros are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in agriculture. Children also perform dangerous tasks in domestic work. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Furthermore, labor and criminal investigators lack the resources and funds necessary to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor, and Comoros lacks a national action plan to combat child labor. Finally, social programs to combat child labor may be insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The national anti-trafficking coordinating body successfully prosecuted several cases of forced child labor, human trafficking, and commercial sexual exploitation. The Ministry of Defense also issued a zero-tolerance policy for child recruitment, and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified and began prosecuting an army officer responsible for operating a child trafficking ring. Moreover, the government's universal primary education decree continued to reduce the number of children vulnerable to labor exploitation and the government task force on the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, in conjunction with the Ministry of Employment, Labor, and Social Welfare, published a manual to address child labor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's agricultural sector. However, children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, tin ore (cassiterite), tantalum ore (coltan), and tungsten ore (wolframite), and are used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it did not publish labor or criminal law enforcement data. The government also failed to take active measures to ensure that children are not inappropriately incarcerated, penalized, or physically harmed solely for unlawful acts as a direct result of being a victim of the worst forms of child labor. Other gaps remain, including a lack of trained enforcement personnel, limited financial resources, and poor coordination of government efforts to combat child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, the Republic of the Congo made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government carried out prosecutions and achieved convictions of seven child traffickers and enacted standalone human trafficking legislation that defines the crime and provides for more stringent sentences. It also concluded a verbal agreement with the Democratic Republic of the Congo that prevents minors from entering the neighboring country without their parents or parental consent to help stop child trafficking between the two countries. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government has yet to accede to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and existing programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor in all relevant sectors. In addition, information on children's work is extremely limited, as there has never been a national child labor survey or similar research conducted in the country.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Cook Islands, in 2020 the government made moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Cook Islands increased its labor inspectorate budget and, for the first time, published labor law enforcement data. In addition, the first Cook Islands Labor Force Survey was completed in November 2020, providing essential data for the government's efforts to bring its laws into line with international standards. Although the Cook Islands made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Costa Rica made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In November, the government ratified the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention of 1930. The government also provided updated statistics on child labor prevalence and published the first findings of its Child Labor Risk Identification Model. In addition, the Attorney General published disaggregated data on efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor, and the Office for the Eradication of Child Labor and Protection of the Adolescent Worker began drafting a new National Action Plan to combat the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Costa Rica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. Furthermore, existing social programs are not accessible to workers in all sectors, and the labor inspectorate lacks the authority to assess penalties for labor violations.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Côte d'Ivoire made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government rescued 138 children from suspected traffickers, the Ministry of Women, Family, and Children created a team of social workers to identify victims of child labor, and the Ministry of Security and Interior created new units to investigate cases of child labor and human trafficking. In addition, as part of its COVID-19 pandemic response, the government established a fund for low-income families known to be vulnerable to child labor. Children in Côte d'Ivoire are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it did not impose penalties for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties, and a lack of financial resources and personnel may have hindered labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Djibouti made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor unveiled a national labor inspection strategy, and for the first time, the labor inspectorate targeted sectors and geographical areas where children are at risk of child labor, including its worst forms. The Ministry of Education and Professional Training also maintained continuity of education for Djibouti's most vulnerable children, including refugees, following nationwide school closures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. However, children in Djibouti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in street work. Minimum age provisions apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards. Law enforcement efforts are also inadequate to prevent and combat child labor, in part because labor inspectors lack the authority to assess penalties. In addition, the government did not make adequate efforts to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor due to lack of financial and human resource allocations and reporting mechanisms.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Dominica, in 2020 the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Dominica's legal framework does not protect children from exploitative work outside of the school year, and the government has not determined the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. The country also lacks prohibitions against the use of children in pornography, or pornographic performances, and the use of children in illicit activities, including the production and trafficking of drugs. During the reporting period, the government did not respond to requests for information related to its efforts to address child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, the Dominican Republic made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established the Oportunidad 14–24 program, with the aim of reintegrating high-risk and socially vulnerable adolescents and young people into technical or vocational education and training programs. To address the education challenges produced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government procured 800,000 tablets and laptops to facilitate instruction, as well as distributed booklets with academic content and activities to nearly two million students. The Attorney General's Office also obtained three convictions against individuals for criminal violations related to the worst forms of child labor.However, children in the Dominican Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Other gaps remain, including limited human and financial resources for the enforcement of child labor laws. Labor inspectors also lack the authority to assess penalties for violations related to child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Ecuador made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion provided assistance to approximately 11,530 children and adolescents vulnerable to child labor and the Attorney General's Office indicted 39 individuals for child labor crimes. In addition, the Technical Secretariat for the Lifetime Plan sent out technical brigades to remote areas in all provinces to assist with medical checkups and other social services for children. The Ministry of Labor also signed a Framework Agreement for Inter-Institutional Cooperation with the Association of Municipalities of Ecuador to implement public policies and programs aimed at the prevention and eradication of child labor. Finally, technical teams from the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion visited 8,425 families to help keep children in school despite the partial lockdown triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, children in Ecuador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in mining. The labor inspectorate continues to lack sufficient resources and children continue to face barriers to education, especially in rural areas.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Egypt made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government announced $50 million in additional funding to support the Takaful and Karama program, which allowed the provision of cash assistance to 309,748 new families to support school attendance for their children. On November 10, 2020, the National Coordinating Committee for Combating and Preventing Illegal Migration and Trafficking in Persons launched the second phase of its "Together Against Human Trafficking" awareness campaign in partnership with the International Organization for Migration. The campaign included a public service announcement featuring prominent Egyptian celebrities that was broadcast on television and displayed on billboards and buses. Additionally, the Ministry of Manpower approved a new action plan for implementing the Accelerating Action for the Elimination of Child Labor in Supply Chains in Africa program. However, children in Egypt are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in quarrying limestone. The government did not publish data on the enforcement of child labor laws, and programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, El Salvador made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Multiple government agencies worked with the International Labor Organization to prepare the 2019 report "New Forms of Child Labor: Use and Recruitment of Boys, Girls and Adolescents for Illicit Gang Activities in El Salvador," which evaluates the relationship between gangs and children to highlight the worst forms of child labor. The government also published results from its Annual Multipurpose Household Survey, which identifies child labor prevalence in the country. Furthermore, the government made publicly available the labor inspectorate's level of funding and increased the number of labor inspectors from 107 to 124. However, children in El Salvador are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and in illicit activities, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of coffee. Law enforcement agencies continued to lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws throughout the country. Gaps also remained related to the implementation of key policies to address child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, Eritrea is receiving an assessment of no advancement because it had a policy of being complicit in the use of forced child labor in more than isolated incidents. Government officials continued to force students in grade 12, some of whom are under the age of 18, to participate in military training elements of the government's compulsory national service program. Otherwise, the government made efforts by maintaining funding for its education programs, and expanding schooling in rural areas prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Children in Eritrea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced military training associated with national service and forced agricultural labor. Moreover, Eritrea's minimum age protections do not apply to children working outside formal employment relationships, and therefore do not conform to international standards. In addition, the government does not have a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Eswatini made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini published their first-ever uniform guidelines for providing shelter and care for victims of human trafficking and gender-based violence. However, children in Eswatini are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, forced livestock herding, and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Significant gaps in the legal framework remain, including gaps in minimum age protections, a lack of legislation regulating the labor conditions under Kuhlehla and other customary practices, and a de facto compulsory education age that does not meet international standards. In addition, minimum age protections only apply to children working in industrial undertakings, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age to work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Ethiopia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Under the Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Persons Proclamation No. 1178, the government overhauled its national counter-trafficking framework, amending penalties for debt bondage, slavery, human trafficking, and certain forms of child labor and sexual exploitation. With external support, the Ministry of Education also announced a school feeding project benefiting 163,021 pre-primary and primary-age students in five regional states. In addition, the Ministry of Labor collaborated with the ILO to develop a digital inspection system, which was completed in 2020. However, children in Ethiopia continue to be subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and in commercial sexual exploitation. The law in Ethiopia does not include free basic education or a compulsory age for education, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor have also not sufficiently targeted sectors with high incidences of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), in 2020 the government made minimal advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the Safeguarding Children’s Board met quarterly and published an annual report on activities through March 2020. The minimum ages for work and for hazardous work do not meet international standards, and the law does not prohibit adults from using, procuring, and offering a child for the production and trafficking of drugs. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Fiji made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved its first National Action Plan and National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking, which contains provisions to address child labor, including its worst forms, and child trafficking in Fiji. Also during the reporting period, the Inter-Agency National Human Trafficking Committee met for the first time since 2011. However, children in Fiji are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Fiji's light work provisions are not specific enough to prevent children from being involved in child labor. In addition, social programs undertaken by the government are insufficient to support children vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and involuntary domestic work.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Gabon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In November, the Ministry of Justice, in coordination with UNICEF, began operating a hotline to alert authorities to possible child abuse cases, including instances of child labor. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Gabon is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to provide evidence it conducted worksite inspections during the reporting period. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Gabon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. Gabonese law regarding minimum age for work provisions only applies to children in formal employment relationships, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age for work. In addition, labor inspectors do not have the authority to assess penalties, and they lack the basic resources necessary to conduct investigations.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Regression in Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, The Gambia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons developed a National Referral Mechanism for victims of human trafficking, and Gambia, The Tourism Authority for the Protection of Children trained hotel staff on the commercial sexual exploitation of children. However, despite these initiatives to address child labor, Gambia, The is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it implemented a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The labor inspectorate suspended inspections in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has not indicated when labor inspections will resume. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Gambia, The are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. Gaps in the law remain, including that children may commence an apprenticeship at the age of 12. In addition, labor inspectors lack legal authorization to inspect private homes or farms in which children may be working.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Georgia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted amendments to the Labor Code that expanded and clarified the roles and duties of the Labor Inspectorate. The government also implemented its new Code on the Rights of the Child beginning in June. In addition, the Healthcare Minister approved a decree that defines hazardous work and light work, as well as lists occupations prohibited for children under 18. In spite of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government made notable efforts to directly address child labor and trafficking in persons, while initiating a number of programs to provide increased support to vulnerable populations. However, children in Georgia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, the labor law governing the minimum age for work does not meet the international standard because it does not apply to informal work. In addition, the Criminal Code does not explicitly prohibit the use of children in illicit activities. Furthermore, the compulsory education age leaves children who are 15 years of age vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor, because they are not required to be in school but are not legally permitted to work full time.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Ghana made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Employment and Labor Relation’s Child Labor Unit developed an Inter-Sectoral Standard Operating Procedure for child protection and family welfare, which provides a framework of agreed standards and procedures for stakeholders. In addition, the government opened a new shelter for child trafficking victims, significantly increased investigations and convictions of child labor crimes, and launched a training of trainers course for labor inspectors. However, children in Ghana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in fishing and cocoa production and harvesting, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Prohibitions related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards as the use of children in pornographic performances is not criminally prohibited, and the law also does not prohibit the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, the government has not acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and resource constraints severely limited the government's ability to adequately enforce labor laws and implement social programs during the reporting period.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Grenada made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Grenada, no official study of child labor has been done to confirm this. The government's ability to prevent children from being subjected to the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition, the government did not authorize the labor inspectorate to assess penalties.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Guatemala made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government created the Inter-Institutional Coordinating Entity Against Labor Exploitation and Child Labor, a new coordinating body aimed at identifying and providing support to victims of human trafficking. It also publicized a WhatsApp number and e-mail address for reporting concerns related to human trafficking, labor exploitation, and the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the government prosecuted 36 cases of alleged child labor crimes and obtained 12 convictions. Guatemala also completed the implementation of the first phase of the Child Labor Risk Identification Model, which is designed to identify child labor vulnerabilities and develop strategies in response. As a result, analysis on risk and protection factors associated with the probability of child labor were developed for the 340 municipalities of the country. However, children in Guatemala are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of coffee. The insufficient number of labor inspectors and resources limited the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare's ability to combat the worst forms of child labor. In addition, existing social programs are insufficient to reach all children engaged in exploitative labor and, in particular, do not target children engaged in domestic work or agriculture.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Guinea made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted a revised Child Code, which provides higher penalties for violations for child labor violations and enumerates a more comprehensive hazardous work list. The government also approved a new National Action Plan to Fight Against Trafficking in Persons. However, children in Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in artisanal mining, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in forced begging. The government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. Laws related to the minimum age for work also do not meet international standards because they do not include children working outside of a formal employment relationship and children who are self-employed. In addition, the government does not implement sufficient social programs to address the extent of the child labor problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Guinea-Bissau made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Institute for Women and Children identified and assisted 75 talibé children with medical assistance, shelter, family identification and the registration of birth certificates. In addition, in October 2020, the government reopened schools with provisions aimed at addressing lost school time due to lengthy teacher strikes and the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase of an additional school day to each week of the school calendar to ensure minimal repercussions to children's education. However, children in Guinea-Bissau are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Furthermore, the minimum age for work is not in compliance with international standards since the law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children without a work contract. Lastly, law enforcement officials do not receive sufficient training and resources to adequately conduct inspections and prosecute cases of child labor, and social programs do not fully address the extent of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Guyana made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established a new Ministry of Labor, which monitors, investigates, and enforces child labor law in collaboration with other government agencies. Guyana also published a National Child Labor Policy with a corresponding national action plan, and it launched a new nationwide trafficking in persons hotline. However, children in Guyana are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in mining. Law enforcement agencies have insufficient financial and human resources to enforce laws related to child labor, including its worst forms, and existing laws do not fully prohibit using children in certain forms of child labor. Moreover, the government does not have targeted social programs to fully address the extent of the child labor problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Haiti made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted the National Social Protection and Promotion Policy that aims to build institutional resilience for social protection against economic shocks and health crises, including efforts to identify and remove children from work and provide vocational training for youth. It also established task forces to combat human trafficking in three provinces, and collected data from 83 organizations to develop an interactive map of service providers for victims of human trafficking in the West, North-East, and Central Plateau regions. However, children in Haiti are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children in Haiti also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and domestic work. Minimum age protections for work apply only to children with a formal employment contract, which does not comply with international standards requiring all children to be protected. In addition, Haiti lacks a clear, easily applicable minimum age for domestic work and a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. Likewise, labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Honduras made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government began implementing the new Child Labor Inspection Protocol, which established guidelines and procedures for inspectors to follow to ensure that inspections appropriately identify and address child labor violations. It also assisted non-governmental partners in the creation of a virtual training platform designed to train inspectors on the Child labor Inspection Protocol. Furthermore, government agencies conducted multiple joint operations targeting child labor throughout the country. However, children in Honduras are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. They are also used to carry out illicit activities, including selling and trafficking drugs.Children also engage in child labor in the production of coffee and melons. Labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lacked financial and human resources, and the government did not adequately report comprehensive data related to its criminal law enforcement efforts. In addition, social programs that address child labor in agriculture have not addressed the problem nationwide, and the government lacks similar programs to eliminate child labor in other sectors, including fishing, mining, and domestic work.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, India made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the national government disbursed $13.5 million in funding to expand Anti-Human Trafficking Units from 332 districts to all 732 districts, and provided additional training and resources to existing units. In March 2020, the Government of Karnataka released comprehensive standard operating procedures on human trafficking in collaboration with civil society organizations. The standard operating procedures cover sex trafficking, child beggary, child labor, and bonded labor. In addition, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, which included workplace safety standards for children ages 14–18, was passed in September 2020. However, children in India are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in garment production, stone quarrying, and brickmaking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of thread and yarn. India also does not meet the international standard for the prohibition of military recruitment by non-state armed groups. Research has found that that no illegal shelter homes were shut down during the reporting period. Research has also found that complicit government officials were not held accountable for helping to operate illegal shelter homes—no criminal cases were initiated against government officials in 2020. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work for long periods of time in unsafe and unhealthy environments, and penalties for employing children are insufficient to deter violations. The government also did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Indonesia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government removed 9,000 children from child labor through the Family Hope Program and subsequently enrolled them in school. The government also increased its allocation to street and abandoned children from $357,142 (IDR 5 billion) in 2019 to $2.7 million (IDR 38.1 billion), helping approximately 68,438 children. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government directed financial resources to families in extreme hardship by providing 96.8 million Indonesians who struggle to meet basic needs with the Indonesia Health Card. However, children in Indonesia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in plantation agriculture, including in palm oil and tobacco production. The Ministry of Manpower continued to lack the financial resources and personnel necessary to fully enforce child labor laws throughout the country. In addition, the government did not publish criminal enforcement information on the number of investigations conducted, violations found, prosecutions initiated, convictions, and imposed penalties for crimes relating to the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Iraq made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Interior investigated several cases implicating Ministry of Interior police and Iraqi Security Forces members in sex trafficking crimes, including prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of six police officers and two Internal Security Forces service members for trafficking boys and girls into sexual exploitation. In addition, theMinistry of Interior upgraded the Anti-Trafficking Directorate from departmental to directorate status and increased its allocationof financial and human resources. However, despite initiatives to address child labor, Iraq is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government authorities continued to inappropriately detain and prosecute without legal representation children allegedly affiliated with ISIS—some of whom were victims of forcible recruitment and use—and used abusive interrogation techniques and torture to gain children’s confessions. Children in Iraq are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and in commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government did not provide information on its labor or criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report. It also continues to lack programs that focus on assisting children involved in the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Jamaica made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a national referral mechanism for child trafficking victims, and significantly increased the budget for the Program for Advancement through Health and Education from $70.7 million in 2019 to $100 million, an expansion that was supplemented with another $6.7 million after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also implemented the Child Labor Risk Identification Model, a preventative tool that identifies geographical areas and sectors with the highest probability of child labor. However, children in Jamaica are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and use in illicit activities. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture and street work. Although the government has laws prohibiting the use of children in some illicit activities, it does not provide higher penalties for using, procuring, or offering children for the production and distribution of drugs than penalties imposed for these same crimes when the victims are adults. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Jordan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2020, for the first time, the Ministry of Labor conducted 850 targeted child labor inspections in the agricultural sector throughout the country. It also developed a new website and mobile phone application that, once operational, will allow the public to report cases of child labor, which will then be logged into the National Child Labor Database. In addition, the Minister of Labor launched the Program to End the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Zarqa and Amman. However, children in Jordan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Insufficient resources hampered the Ministry of Labor’s capacity to ensure compliance with child labor laws in the agricultural sector. Moreover, and despite government efforts, Syrian children still face barriers to accessing education due to socioeconomic pressures, bullying, and the costs associated with transportation and supplies, among other issues. In addition, research was unable to determine whether criminal law enforcement agencies in Jordan conducted investigations on cases related to the worst forms of child labor despite evidence of these worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Kazakhstan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government approved additional funding for increasing the number of shelters for victims of human trafficking, including child victims, improved the bidding process through which shelter providers apply for government funding, and extended funding awards from 1 to 3 years. In addition, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection added forced labor indicators to labor inspection checklists, and updated labor inspectors' job descriptions to include detection and referral of potential forced labor cases to law enforcement. However, children in Kazakhstan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in markets. The government lacks current, comprehensive, and detailed research on child labor, including in cotton production. In addition, labor inspections of small enterprises are permitted only in cases that pose a mass threat to life and health, law and social order, or national security. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Kenya made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government took measures to reinvigorate its National Steering Committee on Child Labor, including by creating and convening the inaugural meeting of a Technical Working Committee,  reinstituted county-level child labor committees, and increased the number of prosecutions for worst forms of child labor. In addition, the government enacted the National Prevention and Response Plan on Violence Against Children to coordinate multi-sectoral activity to address violence against children, including commercial sexual exploitation and other worst forms of child labor. However, children in Kenya are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic service and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Kenya has yet to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. In addition, the gap between the compulsory education age and minimum age for work leaves children ages 14–16 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Moreover, the government also has not committed sufficient resources to child labor law enforcement.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Kiribati made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government published results from the Social Development Indicator Survey conducted in 2018–2019, which provides statistics on child labor. In addition, the government established the Education Sector Contingency Plan for COVID-19 and secured a grant from the Global Partnership for Education to develop remote learning interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Kiribati engage in dangerous tasks in construction and street vending. Existing laws do not identify hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children, and do not prohibit the domestic trafficking of children. In addition, the government has not adopted a national policy to combat the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Kosovo made a moderate advancement to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted multiple regulations for the implementation of the Law on Child Protection to address child labor in the informal sector. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare also began conducting a survey on children engaged in hazardous work and the Committee for Prevention and Elimination of Hazardous Forms of Child Labor drafted an action plan for central- and local-level institutions and civil society organizations on how to coordinate efforts to prevent hazardous child labor. In addition, the government passed the Strategy on the Rights of the Child, which provides a policy framework for the protection of children's rights, including child labor. Moreover, the government worked with UNICEF to launch a new program that aims to increase the availability of early childhood education and promote inclusion of children with disabilities into the education system. However, children in Kosovo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work, including loading and transportation of goods and begging. The Labor Inspectorate and Centers for Social Work also face financial and human resource constraints, which may impede their ability to adequately address child labor. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, the Kyrgyz Republic made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government ratified International Labor Organization P029, Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention, and drafted a National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons for 2021–2024. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Kyrgyz Republic is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a law and practice that delays advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The government extended a 2019 moratorium on labor inspections until 2022. Although the government amended this moratorium in 2020 to permit labor inspections based on formal complaints, the Ministry of Economy must approve worksite visits associated with such inspections, and in practice, it announces these visits in advance. As a result, unannounced inspections remain severely restricted. Children in the Kyrgyz Republic are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Protections to children granted in the Labor Code, such as the minimum age of employment, are not extended to children engaged in non-contractual employment, and research indicated that labor law enforcement efforts are not targeted to all sectors in which children are vulnerable to child labor, especially agriculture. In addition, the scope of social programs to combat child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Lebanon made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting year, the Internal Security Forces reported conducting two training sessions, one for social violence and child labor and a separate training for junior officers who will be in charge of judicial investigations in regional units. However, children in Lebanon are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in construction and in forced labor in agriculture, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in the production of potatoes and tobacco. Laws related to forced labor do not meet international standards as there is no legislative provision that provides criminal penalties for forced labor, and debt bondage is not criminally prohibited. Furthermore, the Ministry of Labor’s budget was unable to cover equipment, personnel, and transportation costs to conduct inspections. In addition, labor inspectors do not have the authority to inspect informal workplaces, in which child labor in Lebanon is most prominent, and programs targeting child labor remained insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Lesotho made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Lesotho’s legislature passed an amendment to the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act that removes the requirement for proof of force, fraud, or coercion even in the case of sex trafficking for minors; the addition of this amendment brings the law up to international standards. The National Police also established the Trafficking in Persons and Migrant Control Unit within the Lesotho Mounted Police Service to oversee human trafficking cases. In addition, multiple trainings were conducted during the reporting period that included: Strategies to Combat Forced Labor; Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking; Countering Trafficking and Victim Identification; and National Shock Responsive Social Protection for the Multisector Impacts of COVID-19. However, children in Lesotho are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in animal herding and domestic work. Lesotho’s compulsory education age is below the minimum age for work, leaving children in between these ages vulnerable to child labor. The government also lacks sufficient coordination mechanisms to combat child labor, and labor inspections are not conducted in high-risk sectors, including the informal sector.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Liberia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the labor inspectorate conducted 1,200 inspections at worksites in 2020, including over 100 unannounced labor inspections, compared to an estimated 236 inspections in 2019. In addition, the government investigated two suspected cases of child trafficking, initiated or advanced the prosecution of three cases, and convicted one individual who awaits sentencing. However, children in Liberia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of rubber and the mining of gold and diamonds. In addition, Liberia has yet to accede to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's Protocol on Armed Conflict and the Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography, and the minimum age for work is not in compliance with international standards. Moreover, social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of the problem in the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Madagascar made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. A national task force created to protect children developed an online portal enabling the public to report cases of child exploitation. Meanwhile, the National Bureau to Combat Human Trafficking conducted an assessment of the expired national action plan to combat human trafficking and finalized a new plan during the reporting period. In response to international reporting, the government drafted a national action plan to combat child labor in the mica sector. Finally, Madagascar expanded services provided through support and reintegration programs by creating new support centers in the cities of Toliara and Tolagnaro. Although Madagascar made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, the government failed to investigate reports of some officials issuing false identity documents to minors in exchange for bribes from tourists seeking to engage in sex with underage girls. Children in Madagascar are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the mica mining sector and in agriculture, including in the production of vanilla. Limited resources for the enforcement of child labor laws may impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor, and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Malawi made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government brought into force the International Labor Organization 2014 Protocol to the Forced Labor Convention and the 2001 Safety and Health in Agricultural Convention, which increase protections against forced labor and child labor in agriculture, respectively. The government also adopted an updated National Action Plan on the Elimination of Child Labor, established district-level coordinating committees to improve responses to child trafficking at the local level, and, with the support of the International Labor Organization, launched a 4 year initiative to address decent work deficits in the tobacco sector, including elimination of child labor. In addition, criminal law enforcement officers increased the number of investigations, prosecutions, and convictions related to the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Malawi are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the harvesting of tobacco and in commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, minimum age laws do not meet international standards because protections do not extend to children working in private homes and non-commercial farms. Prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities also do not meet international standards. Moreover, gaps continue to exist in labor law enforcement related to child labor, including financial resource allocation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Maldives made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In February 2020, the government enacted a new Child Rights Protection Act that criminalizes child labor below the age of 16 and child exploitation, including the use of children to sell drugs. The government also enacted a new Education Act in November 2020 that provides for free public education. During the reporting period, the government reported 335 incidents of commercial sexual exploitation involving children, of which 120 cases resulted in prosecution, and 65 incidents of children being used in illicit activities, including drug trafficking, of which 20 cases were prosecuted. The government also increased the labor inspectorate budget from $572,984 to $929,457. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Maldives are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced labor in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The government has not identified specific hazardous occupations or activities that are prohibited for children, and the law does not sufficiently prohibit the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Moreover, the government does not have a policy or program to address all relevant worst forms of child labor in the country.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Mali made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Mali took steps to prevent children from being recruited and used by the Malian Armed Forces, issuing orders prohibiting the use of children under the age of 15 and banning children from military camps. Mali also enacted a decree permitting the implementation of the mining code, which prohibits child labor in artisanal gold mines. In addition, the government published data on its labor law enforcement efforts, including the number of labor inspections conducted and violations identified. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mali is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it implemented a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The government provided support to non-state armed groups that recruited and used child soldiers in Mali. Children in Mali are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and in armed conflict. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in the production of cotton and rice, and in artisanal gold mining. Although Mali's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Law criminalizes trafficking for the purpose of slavery, it does not more broadly criminalize the act of slavery; this law does not explicitly prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, and allows children under the age of 18 to be penalized as a direct result of forced recruitment by armed groups. In addition, resource constraints severely limited the Malian authorities’ ability to fully implement the National Plan to Combat Child Labor, and social and rehabilitation services for victims of the worst forms of child labor remain inadequate.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Policy and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Mauritania made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a new NGO law (No. 2021-004) that eased requirements for registering non-governmental organizations, potentially helping advance human rights and anti-slavery organizations to be officially recognized. The government also adopted a new Human Trafficking Law (No. 2020/17), and amended the Law on Migrant Smuggling (No. 2010-021) that will support efforts to combat trafficking and addressing smuggling of migrants. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mauritania is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement a policy and a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. Although there were indications of progress, criminal law enforcement authorities did not make adequate efforts to combat slavery and its vestiges during the reporting period. The government prosecuted four defendants and convicted three traffickers in slavery-related cases in the Nouadhibou Anti-Slavery Court, but the government did not initiate any new investigations in 2020. In addition, since 2011, the government has required proof of marriage and biological parents’ citizenship for children to obtain a birth certificate. As a result, children born out of wedlock and many Haratine and Sub-Saharan ethnic minority children, including those of slave descent, have been prevented from being registered at birth. Because birth certificates are required for enrollment in secondary school in Mauritania, children as young as age 12 cannot access education, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Mauritania are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in indentured and hereditary slavery. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, particularly in herding cattle and goats. The government did not make sufficient efforts to enforce some laws related to the worst forms of child labor, including laws on hereditary slavery. In addition, a lack of financial resources and mitigation measures intended to limit the spread of COVID-19 severely limited the government's ability to fully implement policies, and social programs to combat the worst forms of child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem. Moreover, the government did not publish comprehensive information about its labor law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Mauritius made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the National Assembly passed the long-awaited Children's Bill, which includes more robust provisions related to child prostitution and child pornography violations. Also passed was the Children's Court Bill, which sets out to ensure a child-friendly environment during court proceedings and establishes a Criminal Division with jurisdiction over sexual offences against children. In addition, the National Assembly voted to approve the Child Sex Offender Register Bill, which establishes the Child Sex Offender Register that will assist in monitoring, tracking, and investigating sexual offences against children. However, children in Mauritius are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities. In addition, existing prohibitions related to forced labor do not meet international standards because forced labor is criminally prohibited only when it results from human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in construction and street work. There are also many barriers to education access, especially for children with disabilities. In addition, gaps remain in the implementation of key policies and social programs related to child labor, including the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Mexico made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government published the 2019 National Child Labor Survey, the results of which will be used to develop policies and programs to combat child labor. In addition, it ratified International Labor Organization Convention C. 189 on Domestic Workers, and revised the Migration Law and Refugee Assistance and Asylum Law to prioritize the rights of migrant and refugee children, including prohibiting the detention of children in migrant centers and ensuring migrant and refugee children have educational access. Moreover, state governments investigated and prosecuted at least 199 child trafficking cases. The government also approved the creation of a national network of Local Committees to Prevent and Eradicate Child Labor and Protect Adolescent Workers of the Permitted Age to improve coordination efforts to address the worst forms of child labor at the municipal and local levels. Further, it published the National Program on Human Rights 2020–2024 and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare's National Program for 2020–2024. However, children in Mexico are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities, such as the production and trafficking of drugs. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture, including in the production of chile peppers, coffee, sugarcane, and tomatoes. The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the Mexican economy, resulting in a significant increase in the number of children engaging in child labor. Although nearly 60 percent of all employment in Mexico occurs in the informal sector, federal and some state-level labor inspectors carry out inspections in the informal sector only after receiving formal complaints. In addition, labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lacked human and financial resources which may hinder the adequate enforcement of labor and criminal laws, and the government did not publish complete information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Social programs to combat child labor do not address all relevant sectors in which child labor is found in Mexico.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law and Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Moldova made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In January 2021, Parliament adopted Law No. 191, which reversed changes that had delegated responsibility for occupational safety and health inspections to 10 smaller agencies and returned it to the State Labor Inspectorate. The government also enacted legislation aimed at preventing exploitation of children separated from their parents, usually due to labor migration. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Moldova is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a regression in law and practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In August 2018, the government amended Law No. 131 through Law No. 179, such that unannounced inspections, even those based on a complaint or at the request of law enforcement or other state bodies, are permitted only on the basis of a risk assessment that indicates an immediate threat to the environment, life, health, or property. This stringent measure continues to severely limit the State Labor Inspectorate's ability to conduct unannounced inspections. In addition, inspections are only permitted after the State Labor Inspectorate first requests and receives insufficient documentation from the business being inspected or after conducting a risk assessment that finds reasonable indicators of a possible violation. When responding to a complaint, inspectors are not authorized to take action for labor violations they may see which fall outside the scope of the complaint. Children in Moldova are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture. Training is needed for new criminal investigators, and entities responsible for conducting occupational safety and health inspections, including of hazardous child labor, lack adequate capacity to do so. In addition, there is a lack of social programs to address child trafficking and child labor in agriculture.  </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Mongolia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Child Protection Compact Partnership, signed between the Governments of Mongolia and the United States, to combat child labor in the country. The General Agency for Specialized Inspection also conducted three large-scale child labor and protection issue surveys. Furthermore, the government's stimulus package included a five-fold increase for the Children's Money Program—which offsets costs related to food, schooling, and clothing—to mitigate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Mongolia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a regression in law that delayed advancement to eliminate child labor. During the reporting period, the government did not permit the labor inspectorate to conduct unannounced inspections, which may have impeded the enforcement of child labor laws. Children in Mongolia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in mining and horse jockeying. Some Mongolian legal statutes do not meet international standards, including that the minimum age for work does not apply to children in the informal sector or to those who are self-employed. In addition, laws do not establish criminal penalties for forced labor or slavery, the use of children in prostitution, or the use, procurement, or offering of a child for the production and trafficking of drugs.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Montenegro made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government began enforcing the new Labor Law, which provides specific provisions for the conditions allowing a minor to work, and substantially increased the Labor Inspectorate's budget. In addition, the government opened a new shelter for victims of human trafficking and provided services to nine children, including seven children who were previously in forced begging situations. However, children in Montenegro are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. In addition, research found that the scope of programs to address child labor in street work and forced begging is insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Montserrat, in 2020 the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has not determined by national law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited for children. In addition, the law does not prohibit the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups or the use of children in illicit activities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted programs to pilot a child protection network and assess the feasibility of 10 additional child welfare centers. In addition, the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Integration launched a new roadmap for fighting child labor that seeks to: improve the Domestic Work Law 19.12 and make benefits available from the National Social Security Fund to child domestic workers; improve labor inspection at the 54 designated centers across the country by hiring specialists to enhance the oversight of inspections and the methodology behind interventions; strengthen partnerships with civil society organizations; and increase international cooperation on child labor. Morocco also became a Pathfinder country under Alliance 8.7, which calls for the eradication of child labor by 2025, and forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking by 2030. However, children in Morocco are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in producing artisanal handicrafts. Laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties. In addition, research could not determine whether penalties were imposed for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. Furthermore, the scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Mozambique made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a new 2020–2024 Five Year Plan, which emphasizes eliminating child labor, and published the number of labor inspectors for the first time since 2017. The government also enacted a new Penal Code, which includes prohibitions on human trafficking, child prostitution, and the use of children in pornography. In addition, Provincial and District National Reference Groups were trained on human trafficking laws, the identification and protection of victims, prevention of unsafe child migration and on how to report cases of human trafficking. However, children in Mozambique are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in the production of tobacco. In addition, the established minimum age for work is not in compliance with international labor standards because it does not extend to informal employment. Lastly, existing programs are insufficient to fully address the extent of the child labor problem in Mozambique.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Namibia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Namibia ratified International Labor Organization Convention 189, the Domestic Workers Convention, which reaffirms the government's commitment to eliminate child labor in domestic work. The government also expanded its school feeding program to provide take-home food rations for vulnerable households during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, criminal law enforcement officials participated in training on the implementation of the Child Care and Protection Act to strengthen responses to child victims of the worst forms of child labor and other forms of exploitation. However, children in Namibia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in domestic work and street work. Prevention and elimination of child labor are not integrated into key national policies. In addition, social programs do not address child labor in agriculture and domestic work. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Nepal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government acceded to the Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. It also published the Report on Employment Relationship Survey in the Brick Industry in Nepal, which provides information on the prevalence of child labor, forced labor, and bonded labor in the brick production sector. In addition, the government drafted an action plan for the elimination of child labor to facilitate the implementation of the Second National Master Plan on the Elimination of Child Labor, which aims to abolish all forms of child labor by 2025 and the worst forms of child labor by 2022. However, children in Nepal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in the production of bricks. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet international standards for legal prohibitions against child trafficking and legal prohibitions against the use of children for illicit activities. In addition, the Department of Labor’s budget, the number of labor inspectors, and available resources and training are insufficient for enforcing labor laws, including those related to child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Nicaragua made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government established the program Women for Life, Peace, and Wellbeing Plan, with the aim of providing critical attention to victims of domestic violence and sexual violence, as well as trafficking in persons. However, children in Nicaragua are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Laws do not establish a clear compulsory education age, and national policies to eliminate child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented. The government also lacks a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Niger made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government hired additional labor inspectors and carried out several capacity training workshops. However, children in Niger were subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in hereditary slavery and mining, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks herding cattle.  The minimum age for work does not meet international standards because it does not apply to children in unpaid or non-contractual work. In addition, the particular type of slavery known as wahaya, while illegal, continues to exist. Gaps in labor law enforcement also remain, including insufficient funding for labor inspectors to conduct inspections. Also, social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Nigeria made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Nigerian Government continued to support the National Action Plan for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism which helps end use and recruitment of child soldiers by identifying and formally separating children from armed groups, including 209 boys and 6 girls in 2020. In addition, the Nigerian Government hired over 400 new labor inspectors and enacted the National Social Behavioral Change Communication Strategy for Elimination of Child Labor in Nigeria (2020–2023). However, children in Nigeria are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in quarrying granite, artisanal mining, commercial sexual exploitation, and use in armed conflict, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Child's Right Act has been adopted by only 25 out of Nigeria's 36 states, leaving the remaining 11 states in northern Nigeria with legal statutes that do not meet international standards for the prohibition of child trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, and illicit activities. In addition, the minimum age for work in the Labour Act does not apply to children who are self-employed or working in the informal economy.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Niue, in 2020 the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The law does not criminally prohibit the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, the production of pornography, or pornographic performances, or the use of children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. In addition, Niue has not established a minimum age for work and lacks a law that prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists on Norfolk Island, in 2020, the government made moderate advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Australia adopted a new National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery 2020–2025. The federal government also published a Modern Slavery Statement that discussed efforts to reduce child labor and human trafficking risks in federal government operations and procurement supply chains. However, Norfolk Island's laws do not set a minimum age for light work, which is not in compliance with international standards. In addition, the law does not specify activities in which light work may be permitted.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, North Macedonia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Education and Science continued to hire additional educational mediators with the goal of removing barriers to education for the most vulnerable populations, including Roma children. Parliament also amended the Law on Labor Relations to increase fines on employers that fail to provide adequate protections to workers under age 18. In addition, the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy developed Action Plan 2020–2022 in accordance with the National Strategy to Protect Children from All Forms of Abuse. However, children in North Macedonia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The law’s minimum age protections do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships. Additionally, the government has not adopted a policy to address all worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Oman made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In December 2020, the Royal Oman Police stood up a dedicated counter-trafficking in persons unit for responding directly to reports of human trafficking and implementing anti-trafficking best practices within the Royal Oman Police. In August 2020, the Ministry of Labor created its own dedicated counter-trafficking in persons unit under its Inspection Department. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a specialized trafficking in persons office in March 2020. Although research is limited, there is evidence that small numbers of children in Oman engage in child labor, including in fishing and selling items in kiosks. Government policies do not address all forms of child labor and the Ministry of Labor is not represented on the National Committee on Implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child or the National Child Protection Committee.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Pakistan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In February, the government formally constituted and appointed members to the National Commission on the Rights of the Child, which includes two representatives who are children. Additionally, in response to the fatal beating of an 8-year-old domestic worker by her employer, the Islamabad Capital Territory cabinet banned child domestic labor under age 14 in the capital territory. The Pakistani government also added domestic labor to the list of occupations defined as hazardous work prohibited for children under the Employment of Children Act 1991. Children in Pakistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in forced labor in brick kilns and agriculture. The federal government and Balochistan Province have not established a minimum age for work or hazardous work in compliance with international standards. In addition, provincial labor inspectorates do not receive sufficient resources to adequately enforce laws prohibiting child labor, and the federal and provincial governments did not publicly release information on their labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Further, police corruption, particularly the taking of bribes from suspected perpetrators to ignore child labor crimes and lack of willingness to conduct criminal investigations, hindered Pakistan's ability to address the problem throughout the country.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Panama made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government successfully prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced its first forced child labor case, and it provided social services to 1,500 child victims and children at risk of child labor. It also established a Network of Companies Against Child Labor with the participation of the National Council of Private Enterprise and technical advice from the International Labor Organization, with the aim of creating a certification seal for products produced free of child labor. However, children in Panama are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Panamanian law allows minors under age 16 to engage in hazardous work within training facilities in violation of international standards. Moreover, the Ministry of Labor lacks the authority to collect fines for labor violations, limiting its capacity to enforce laws on the worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Papua New Guinea made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the National Council for Child and Family Services developed criteria for the appointment of child protection officers and appointed 42 child protection officers. However, children in Papua New Guinea are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Papua New Guinea's hazardous work prohibitions do not comply with international standards that require all children under age 18 to be protected from work that could jeopardize their health and safety, nor do its laws prohibit using, procuring, or offering a child for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. Schools continued charging fees as a result of not receiving promised government subsidies needed for education to remain free and accessible for all children. In addition, insufficient resources hamper the labor inspectorate’s capacity to enforce child labor laws.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Paraguay made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor launched virtual training curricula for inspectors and created a labor complaint hotline. Local Defense Councils for the Rights of Children were also involved in child labor investigations, and in December 2020, the government approved a National Plan to Counter Trafficking in Persons. However, children in Paraguay are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic servitude, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, as well as debt bondage in cattle raising, on dairy farms, and in charcoal factories. Children from rural and indigenous communities also face difficulties accessing and completing their education, including language barriers and inadequate facilities and staff at schools. In addition, limited funding for law enforcement agencies and social programs hampered the government’s ability to fully address the worst forms of child labor, particularly in rural areas. Paraguay's criminal law enforcement agencies also lack resources to sufficiently identify, investigate, and prosecute cases of the worst forms of child labor, especially in remote areas.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Peru made significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government passed Law 31047, which set the minimum age for domestic work at 18 years. The labor inspectorate also carried out joint inspections with the police to identify children working in dangerous conditions in Lima's garment district. In addition, a regional ordinance was enacted to create provincial and district commissions to fight trafficking in persons, migrant smuggling, and forced labor in the Arequipa Region. The Ministry of Labor granted the Child Labor Free Seal certification to seven socially responsible businesses that produce agricultural export goods. The Street Educators program also assisted over 6,000 children. However, children in Peru are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Peruvian law allows children ages 12 to 14 to do light work without specifying the activities in which children may work. Also, labor law enforcement agencies in Peru lack sufficient inspectors and training to adequately combat child labor, and the government did not provide complete information on labor or criminal enforcement efforts against the worst forms of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, the Philippines made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment a U.S. citizen for "large-scale qualified trafficking in persons," making it the first online sexual exploitation of children conviction of a foreigner in the country and enabling the largest seizure of digital evidence to date. The government also established the Philippine National Multi-Sectoral Strategic Plan on Children in Street Situations to address the needs of street children. In addition, the House of Representatives passed House Bill No. 7836, which will raise the age of sexual consent from age 12 up to age 16, while eliminating a provision in the Penal Code that protected rapists from penalty if they proposed marriage to their victims. However, children in the Philippines are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture and gold mining. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it did not adequately protect children allegedly engaged in drug trafficking from inappropriate incarceration or physical harm during detention. The government also did not ensure that children released from custody were placed in accredited rehabilitation centers. In addition, the government failed to take law enforcement action against officials who facilitated the production of fraudulent identity documents or were otherwise complicit in human trafficking. Moreover, the enforcement of child labor laws remained challenging throughout the country, especially due to the low number of inspectors, lack of resources for inspections, and inspectors’ inability to assess penalties.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Rwanda made moderate advancement in efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor. The government passed a new education law that incorporates provisions to address barriers to education for girls and children with disabilities. Rwanda also released two child labor studies measuring child labor prevalence in specific districts across the country and continued to significantly increase its number of labor inspections, including child labor inspections. In addition, the government centralized its child rights protection efforts with the creation of the National Child Development Agency. Rwanda also began implementing a new labor procedure manual that provides guidance to local authorities on roles and responsibilities for child labor law enforcement. Although Rwanda made meaningful efforts across all relevant areas during the reporting period, reports indicate that government officials have detained children subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and forced street begging in transit centers intended for individuals demonstrating so-called deviant behaviors, in which children often experience physical abuse. Children in Rwanda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining, including carrying heavy loads. The number of labor inspectors does not meet the International Labor Organization's technical advice for the size of the workforce. Finally, social programs do not address all relevant sectors in which child labor is present.    </Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Saint Helena, Ascensión, and Tristán da Cunha, in 2020 the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has yet to define by law or regulation the types of hazardous work prohibited to children, other than work on vessels engaged in maritime navigation. Gaps also remain in legislation related to forced child labor and the trafficking of children for labor exploitation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Saint Lucia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a comprehensive study to assess economically vulnerable populations in the country. The study will ultimately provide recommendations on effective ways to help the identified populations. The Trafficking in Persons Task Force also raised awareness through social media platforms and issued several press releases related to human trafficking. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Lucia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in the sale and distribution of drugs. Saint Lucia's legal framework does not sufficiently protect children from hazardous work and illicit activities. In addition, policies addressing all forms of child labor, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, do not exist.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Unit funded and conducted specialized human trafficking training for 181 new police recruits, the entire staff of the Sexual Offenses Unit, and participants in the police force's 2020 Basic Development Training Course. In addition, a new National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking was approved for 2021–2025, and campaigns aimed at increasing public awareness of human trafficking were conducted at Argyle International Airport and other popular gathering sites, as well as on radio and television announcements. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps remain in the legal framework, as the law does not fully meet international standards because the use of children for prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances is not prohibited. In addition, the minimum age for hazardous work falls below international standards and there is no legislation prohibiting the using, procuring and offering of children in illicit activities, including in the production of drugs. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Samoa made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government submitted two pieces of draft legislation, the Labour and Employment Relations Amendment Act 2020 and the Child Protection Bill 2020, to be considered during the next session of parliament. Children in Samoa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in street vending. Research found no evidence of laws that prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities, including for the production and trafficking of drugs. While the government has a mechanism to coordinate inter-agency efforts to address child labor, it did not meet during the reporting period. In addition, the government did not publicly release information on its labor law enforcement or criminal law enforcements efforts.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Senegal made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. A government initiative to address the COVID-19 pandemic through the "Zero Children" program removed 5,130 children from the streets, many of whom were victims of forced begging. The National Task Force Against Trafficking in Persons also finalized its National Action Plan for 2021–2023. In addition, the government created a new coordination mechanism that includes a National Unit for Coordination, Monitoring, and Follow Up of Emergency Protection of Children Against COVID-19. However, children in Senegal are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining. Hazardous work prohibitions do not include domestic work or street work, areas in which there is evidence of potential harm to child workers, and labor and criminal law enforcement agencies lack resources to adequately enforce child labor law. In addition, an overlap of mandated activities among mechanisms to coordinate efforts to address child labor creates confusion and obstructs effective collaboration.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Serbia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government increased the budget of the Labor Inspectorate and implemented online trainings for labor inspectors. Additionally, the government adopted a Strategy for Prevention and Protection of Children from Violence (2020–2023) and created a Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography, which will allow children's issues to be addressed by a single ministry rather than being split among multiple government ministries. However, children in Serbia remain subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in street work. Serbia's laws do not treat forced child beggars as victims of child labor, and the country's social welfare centers are overburdened, which limits efforts to provide services to victims of child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Sierra Leone made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched a new National Action Plan Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and carried out an awareness-raising campaign to promote education access for girls. However, children in Sierra Leone are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in quarrying stone and fishing. The types of hazardous work prohibited for children do not cover all sectors in which child labor is known to occur, and the government does not have a sufficient number of labor inspectors to adequately enforce labor laws throughout the country. In addition, Sierra Leone lacks a national policy and social program to address all relevant worst forms of child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, the Solomon Islands made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government created a revised version of its National Action Plan against Human Trafficking and People Smuggling and partnered with private companies to create and implement human trafficking awareness-raising campaigns targeting 12 communities in the Choiseul Province. However, children in the Solomon Islands are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in the harvesting of palm oil fruits. The minimum age for work does not meet international standards, and the Solomon Islands has not established a minimum age for hazardous work or delineated the types of work considered hazardous for children. The government also did not publish labor and criminal law enforcement data for the reporting year. In addition, education is not compulsory, which increases children’s vulnerability to child labor exploitation.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Somalia made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs established a Labor Inspectorate and hired and trained 35 labor inspectors. The government also created an Office for the Senior Advisor on Child Labor to lead the drafting and implementation of a National Action Plan to address the worst forms of child labor. Following nationwide school closures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Education worked with UNICEF to educate 141,816 children via Internet, television, and radio platforms. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Somalia is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, there is evidence that federal and state security forces, as well as clan militias and al-Shabaab, continued to recruit and use children in armed conflict, in violation of national law. Children in Somalia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. Children also perform dangerous tasks in street work. Somali laws do not criminally prohibit child trafficking for labor, commercial sexual exploitation, or the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, South Africa made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of South Africa increased its Child Support Grant, providing an additional $35 per month on top of the existing $33 per month to low-income recipients with children. However, children in South Africa are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation and forced begging, each sometimes as the result of human trafficking. Labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties, and social programs are not sufficient to address the scope of child labor. In addition, barriers to education remain, especially among migrant children who lack proper identification documents.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>No Advancement – Efforts Made but Complicit in Forced Child Labor</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, South Sudan is receiving an assessment of no advancement. Despite initiatives to address child labor, South Sudan is assessed as having made no advancement because it demonstrated a practice of being complicit in the use of forced child labor in more than isolated incidents. Military forces continued to recruit children, sometimes forcibly, to fight opposition groups. Otherwise, the government made efforts by signing into law a United Nations comprehensive action plan to end grave violations against children, inaugurating a juvenile court, and deploying a distance-learning program that reached 1.5 million children. Children in South Sudan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including use in armed conflict and cattle herding. The government did not hold perpetrators of child labor accountable and has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons. In addition, police continued to arrest and imprison children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation rather than treating them as victims.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Sri Lanka made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government raised the minimum age for employment from 14 to 16 years, which is also the compulsory education age. It also took steps towards implementing the regulations on the Hazardous Occupations Regulations Gazette under the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act, and developed a COVID-19 Child Vulnerability Survey. Furthermore, the government increased its number of labor inspectors from 494 to 588 and approved a new National Strategic Plan to Monitor and Combat Human Trafficking (2021–2025). Finally, the government implemented a cash transfer program for families who lost their income due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other social welfare programs targeting low-income households that are aimed at reducing the economic vulnerabilities of children. However, children in Sri Lanka are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking.  Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, research indicates some victims of child trafficking or commercial sexual exploitation may be penalized for prostitution and other offenses rather than treated as victims. In addition, the labor inspectorate is not authorized to assess penalties for labor law violations. Some children in rural areas face barriers to accessing education, including difficulties in traveling to school in some regions and an inadequate number of teachers. Also, the government does not fully disaggregate criminal data, including cases investigated for forced child labor, child trafficking, child commercial sexual exploitation, and the use of children in illicit activities.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Suriname made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government drafted and approved a new National Action Plan for the Prevention and Response to Trafficking in Persons. It also hired 20 new labor inspectors, increasing the size of the Labor Inspectorate from 50 to 70. However, children in Suriname are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Prohibitions related to the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards. In addition, the compulsory education age does not reach the minimum age for employment, leaving some children vulnerable to labor exploitation. Suriname also lacked targeted inspections in risk-prone sectors.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, São Tomé and Príncipe made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government launched the Girls Empowerment and Quality Education for All project, which aims to provide safe learning spaces, improve school infrastructure, and work with families and communities to empower girls with relevant life skills. The program also aims to increase school readiness for both boys and girls by substantially boosting education, in particular within the areas of literacy and numeracy. The government also created the Department of Child Protection, which is housed under the Directorate of Social Protection and Solidarity. The new department leads a multi-sector team focused on combating child labor. However, children in São Tomé and Príncipe are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Labor Code permits children younger than age 14 to work under certain circumstances, which is not consistent with international standards. Lastly, limited financial resources hampered law enforcement efforts, and criminal law enforcement did not take actions to combat child labor during the reporting period. In addition, the National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor was not implemented due to a lack of financial resources.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, The United Republic of Tanzania made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Zanzibar Government increased funding of its labor inspectorate and hired an additional 16 labor inspectors. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tanzania is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The Mainland Government explicitly supports the routine expulsion of pregnant students from public schools, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Tanzania are subjected to the worst forms of child Iabor, including in mining, quarrying, and domestic work, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Mainland Government did not publicly release information on its labor and criminal law enforcement efforts. Other gaps remain in the legal framework and enforcement of laws related to child labor, including protections for child engagement in illicit activities and domestic work; the lack of authorization for the labor inspectorate to assess penalties; and the likely insufficient number of labor inspectors for the size of Tanzania’s labor force.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Thailand made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government made its Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force into a permanent agency, and led the biggest and most successful online child sexual exploitation sting operations in Thailand. The government also collaborated closely with U.S. law enforcement agencies and other partners, leading to 97 arrests for the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the rescue of 43 children. In total, Thai police rescued 72 children from commercial sexual exploitation in 2020. In addition, the government enacted a law that sets the minimum age for workers employed as deep sea divers at 18 years old and proposed an amendment allowing teenage children of boat captains to intern only on their family's fishing boats. The government also piloted its first shelter to provide services specifically to LGBTQI+ victims. However, children in Thailand are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children, some as young as age 12, also participate for remuneration in Muay Thai competitions, an area of hazardous work in which there is evidence of serious head injuries. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas during the reporting period, it does not meet the international standard for the minimum age for work because the law does not grant protections to children working outside of formal employment relationships. Enforcement of child labor laws also remains a challenge due to an insufficient number of inspectors and resources to physically inspect remote workplaces in informal sectors. </Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Timor-Leste made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Inter-Agency Anti-Trafficking Working Group continued work on the draft decree that outlines the roles and responsibilities of the yet-to-be established Anti-Trafficking Commission, and the National Commission Against Child Labor met regularly throughout the year. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Timor-Leste is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement due to a continued practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. While no law or policy prohibits pregnant girls from attending school, reports during the reporting period indicate that orders from school principals forced girls to leave school when they became pregnant, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children in Timor-Leste are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in agriculture. In addition, there is a lack of training on child labor laws for labor inspectors and criminal investigators. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Togo made moderate advancement in its efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government adopted a National Action Plan for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor and passed a ministerial decree, which defined and prohibited hazardous work for children under 18 years old. In addition, the government intercepted 250 children at risk of human trafficking at the border and provided them social services. However, children in Togo are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in domestic work. The government has not devoted sufficient resources to combat child labor, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties for child labor violations. In addition, the government does not publish data related to its efforts to criminal enforcement of child labor laws.</Description>

    <Description>Although research found no evidence that child labor exists in Tokelau, in 2020 the government made no advancement in efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. The government has not established adequate legal protections to prevent the worst forms of child labor, as the law does not criminally prohibit forced labor and child trafficking. In addition, Tokelau has not established a minimum age for work and does not prohibit hazardous occupations for children.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Tonga made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government ratified International Labor Organization Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. In addition, the government released the results of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, the first nationwide survey on children and women in Tonga. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Tonga is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continued to implement a practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Research indicates that there are no labor inspectors and there is no legal authority to conduct labor inspections. Labor inspections are a key tool for identifying child labor violations, and their absence makes children more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. Children are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in farming and fishing. Gaps in the legal framework also remain; the country has no laws specifying a minimum age for work or defining hazardous forms of work for children under age 18, leaving children unprotected from labor exploitation. In addition, the government has not integrated child labor elimination and prevention strategies into relevant policies to address child labor, including its worst forms.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Tunisia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Social Affairs published a list of hazardous work that is prohibited for children. The Ministry of Education also introduced a new Second Chance program for children who dropped out of school that would assist them in either completing their education or receiving vocational training. In addition, the government provided cash transfers to families to help mitigate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, children in Tunisia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in domestic work and begging, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in scavenging for garbage and in street work. The law’s minimum age protections cannot be enforced with respect to children who are engaged in work on inhabited premises, such as private homes, without permission of the property owner, a complaint to child protection delegates, or a court order to access the property. The government provided partial data on its criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Tuvalu made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, the government, with support from UNICEF, conducted the 2019–2020 Tuvalu Social Development Indicator Survey to assess the prevalence and cause of child labor. The government also secured a Global Partnership for Education grant to help develop remote learning materials and provide teachers with training on remote learning interventions. In addition, the government finalized the 2017 Child Care and Welfare Bill, which, if passed, will be the first law in Tuvalu to have comprehensive provisions for issues related to children's rights, including child labor. However, although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Tuvalu engage in child labor in fishing and domestic work. The government has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. In addition, Tuvalu lacks information on labor law and criminal law enforcement efforts.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Uganda made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Uganda launched new policies to address the worst forms of child labor, including an action plan to combat trafficking in persons and a child protection policy that prioritizes the elimination of child labor. In partnership with international stakeholders, Uganda also began implementing the Accelerating Action for the Elimination of Child Labor in Supply Chains in Africa program, specifically targeting child labor in coffee and tea production. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Uganda is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued a practice that delays advancement to eliminate child labor. The government failed to prosecute, convict, and sentence public officials,including police and immigration officers,who participate in orfacilitatetheworstforms of child labor, including child trafficking. Children in Uganda are subjected to the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in gold mining.  Gaps in the legal framework persist, including inadequate laws regulating the minimum age for employment and hazardous work. In addition, the lack of a centralized supervisory authority along with inadequate funding, training, and resources, hampered the capacity of law enforcement agencies to conduct child labor inspections and investigations. Finally, the government has not taken steps to implement its National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Law that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Ukraine made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers adopted a resolution implementing a risk-based approach to conducting planned inspections, including the use of child labor as one of the criteria for assessing risk. It also implemented measures to address undocumented work, including signing a Memorandum of Understanding on decent work with the International Labor Organization. The number of labor inspectors increased significantly from 2019, and the government reported that all inspections were unannounced. However, despite new initiatives to address child labor, Ukraine is receiving an assessment of minimal advancement because it continues to implement a regression in law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In August 2019, the government issued Cabinet of Ministers Decree No. 823, which requires that businesses receive notification at least 5 working days in advance of an onsite labor inspection where previously no such notification was required. Although unannounced inspections reportedly took place during the reporting period, the decree remains in place. Children in Ukraine are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in the production of pornography. Children also perform dangerous tasks in mining. Children living in the Russia-controlled Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and Russia-occupied Crimea are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation as the government of Ukraine does not have control over these regions and is therefore not able to address the worst forms of child labor due to the ongoing conflict. The government also collected few of the financial penalties imposed for child labor violations and lacked social programs designed to assist children engaged in hazardous work in mining.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Uzbekistan made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government took active measures to prevent the use of child labor in the cotton harvest, including by eliminating the harvest quotas that were historically a root cause of child and forced labor in Uzbekistan. The government also cooperated with civil society activists to detect labor exploitation in the annual cotton harvest, created an action plan to implement international recommendations on eliminating the worst forms of child labor, and expanded efforts to raise awareness during the cotton cultivation season about child and forced labor prohibitions. In addition, lawmakers adopted a new law on trafficking in persons that strengthened protection for human trafficking victims, including child trafficking victims.However, children in Uzbekistan are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Although the government made meaningful efforts in all relevant areas, laws prohibiting the commercial sexual exploitation of children do not meet international standards. Uzbekistan also has not carried out a national child labor survey to determine the prevalence of child labor in sectors other than cotton production.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Vanuatu made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government increased access to education by granting a school-fee exemption for the 2020 academic year, in addition to other measures such as increasing Internet capacity in schools for online schooling. The government also reconvened the National Children Protection Working Group. Although research is limited, children in Vanuatu are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in dangerous tasks in forestry. Vanuatu’s minimum age for hazardous work is too low to comply with international standards. Vanuatu also lacks a referral mechanism between criminal authorities and social services providers. In addition, the Government of Vanuatu did not respond to requests for information for this report.</Description>

    <Description>For the 2020 reporting period, no assessment has been made regarding Wallis and Futuna’s efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because there is no evidence of a worst forms of child labor problem and the country has a good legal and enforcement framework on child labor.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, the Palestinian Authority made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the areas of the West Bank under its control. The Ministry of Social Development conducted an inspection campaign in Nablus aimed at stemming child labor. The Palestinian Authority also cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund to reach 11,900 Palestinian children with psychosocial support, provide 3,496 tablets pre-loaded with educational materials, support the Ministry of Education in developing school safety protocols, and provide hygiene and cleaning supplies to 2,250 school premises. However, children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in illicit activities. Children also perform dangerous tasks in construction and fishing. The Palestinian Authority’s legal framework does not criminally prohibit all elements of child trafficking, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties. In addition, Palestinian Authority programs to prevent or eliminate child labor are insufficient.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Morocco made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Kingdom of Morocco claims the territory of Western Sahara and administers the area that it controls by the same constitution, laws, and structures as in internationally recognized Morocco, including laws that deal with child labor. In 2020, the government enacted programs to pilot a child protection network and assess the feasibility of 10 additional child welfare centers. In addition, the Ministry of Labor launched a new roadmap for fighting child labor that seeks to: improve Domestic Work Law 19.12 and make benefits available from the National Social Security Fund to child domestic workers; improve labor inspection at the 54 designated centers across the country by hiring specialists to enhance the oversight of inspections and the methodology behind interventions; strengthen partnerships with civil society organizations; and increase international cooperation on child labor. Morocco also became a Pathfinder country under Alliance 8.7 in 2020, which calls for the eradication of child labor by 2025, and forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking by 2030. However, children in Western Sahara are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and in commercial sexual exploitation. Children also engage in child labor in producing artisanal handicrafts. Laws related to the minimum age for work and the use of children for illicit activities do not meet international standards, and labor inspectors are not authorized to assess penalties. In addition, research could not determine whether penalties were imposed for violations related to the worst forms of child labor. Furthermore, the scope of government programs that target child labor is insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.</Description>

    <Advancement_Level>Minimal Advancement – Efforts Made but Continued Practice that Delayed Advancement</Advancement_Level>
    <Description>In 2020, Yemen made minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2020, the government trained judges and employers in Hadramawt and Ma’rib on the harms of child labor and child soldier recruitment. Despite this initiative to address child labor, however, Yemen is assessed as having made only minimal advancement because it continued to implement practices that delay advancement to eliminate child labor.There is evidence of recruitment and use of children in hostilities by state armed forces in contravention of Yemeni law. Furthermore, the government failed to make efforts to address discrimination in schools against children from the Muhamasheen (“marginalized”) community, leading to their increased vulnerability to child labor. Children in Yemen are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and armed conflict, including by Houthi (also known as Ansar Allah) insurgent forces and other armed groups. Children also engage in child labor in fishing. Research found no evidence of a policy on worst forms of child labor outside of child soldiering, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child trafficking. Moreover, the Republic of Yemen Government continued to exert limited operational control over its ministries and was unable to enforce regulations to combat child labor. </Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Zambia made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government significantly increased funding for its labor inspectorate and finalized its second National Action Plan for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. It also reinvigorated key coordinating bodies, including the National Steering Committee on Child Labor and the National Coordinating Committee for Children. However, children in Zambia are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. The Education Act does not specify a compulsory education age, and human trafficking laws do not meet international standards because they require threats, the use of force, or coercion to establish the crime of child trafficking. In addition, labor inspectors do not routinely inspect non-registered businesses in which child labor is known to occur.</Description>

    <Description>In 2020, Zimbabwe made moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The government enacted the Education Amendment Act, which raised the legal compulsory education age to 16. It also significantly expanded the Basic Education Assistance Module to provide assistance with school expenses to over 950,000 orphans and vulnerable children, while providing humanitarian assistance allowances for vulnerable families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, children are subjected to the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, mining, and tobacco production, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Children also engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the harvesting of sugarcane. The government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts, and law enforcement agencies lack resources to enforce child labor laws. In addition, gaps remain in the country’s legal framework against child labor, including the prohibition of commercial sexual exploitation of children.</Description>
